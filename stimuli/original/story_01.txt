There're some scientists who say that the universe that we inhabit {BR} is not the only universe there is. {BR} There are alternate universes. {BR} They say that these universes arise {BR} from the sub atomic realm of quantum physics. Here's how they say it works. {BR} Every time a quantum event happens, {BR}, it produces all of its possible results. This is like saying if you flip a coin {BR} it comes up heads, but it also comes up tails. {BR} Since those two results are mutually exclusive, {BR} the flipping of the coin splits the Universe {BR} into two alternate universes {BR}. The "heads" universe, and the "tails" universe {BR}. And since quantum events are happening all the time, {BR}, it means that alternate universes {BR} are bubbling up continually, they're always being created, splitting off from ours {BR}. And these alternate universes {BR} are real, they're not just figments of the imagination {BR}. They're complete, whole, real things. I know this is true, {BR} because I experienced an alternate universe. 

{LG} {LS} I was driving in my volkswagen van, {BR} up to a Tai Chi camp, in upstate New York a couple of summers ago. {BR} Um I bought the Volkswagen van when I'd quit my job a few years previously {BR} . I bought the van um because I quit the job as a custom database application engineer. {BR} This was not a job that I really had intended to become, when I was a kid, that's not what I thought I was going to be {BR}. Uh it's just sort of the job I happened into, and I always thought of it as the work I was doing before I was gonna find my real work. {BR} But when I got close to about forty, I suddenly thought "oh my god, this could be it". {BR} This could be what I end up doing, this could be on my tombstone. {BR} Tom Wiser, custom database application engineer. {LG} {BR} Wrote well optimized queries. {LG} Many customers satisfied. {LG} {BR} And I thought, no, that that can't be, it, that can't be all there is. And I quit the job, {BR} without really knowing what I was going to do next, and {BR} and and I knew that what I should do was to take my skill set {BR}, and to make a lateral move to a career path that was more appropriate, but {BR} but I I I really didn't want to do that. I didn't want to be so logical. I actually wanted something more {BR} magic. I {BR} I wanted to be like the guy in the fairy tale that {BR} trades the cow for the magic beans. {BR} and and I know that that's a bad deal, I know {BR} that the cow's a better investment. {BR} {LG} The cow's gonna pay off in the long term, but but {BR} but but if the magic beans work out, {BR} you're in a whole new story. 

{BR} So {LG} so so I quit the job and I bought a Volkswagen pop top camper van. {BR} And I drove around country in what I thought was, OK. {BR} I'm not going to make a lateral move, I am  going to drive around the country, and I'm gonna open myself up to whatever may come, and then what I'm going to do {BR} is going to arise organically {BR} I'm gonna find my next path there {BR} by the side of the road in Arizona, I'm gonna pick it up, and bring it back to New York. {BR} So, I drove around the country. {BR} Twenty five thousand miles, eight months. {BR} And when I got back to New York {LS} I had no clue. {LG} I really didn't know, and and it left me very vulnerable {BR} to the New York question. {BR} The first question that anybody asks. Which is, "so what do you do?" {LG} I didn't know. I had, I had I didn't have a good answer and it made me feel really embarrassed because {BR} everybody knows what they do, everybody does, and I thought I should, too. {BR}. 

So when I was driving the Volkswagen van up to Tai Chi camp,  the other summer, I I felt very relieved because in camp, I know what I do. {BR} I do the camp thing. I do what's at camp and {BR} I don't know if you know this, but there are a lot of camps for adults that are out there. I I found them when I was driving around the country {BR}. There are Tai Chi camps and Yoga camps and {BR} and bird watching camps. There's even a camp where you can dress up in armor and joust. {LG} {LS} {BR} All the things that that give us joy and that we tend to demean with the name hobby. {BR} Those are the things that are that are celebrated in camp. {BR} And when people go to camp they are so lit up, they are finally getting to do that thing, the thing they love, it's like "yes, {BR} I finally get to joust, I don't have time for that anymore {BR} really." {LG} 

So I was going up to camp and feeling pretty good about it and I decided {BR} on the way I would stop into Ithaca. {BR} I heard it was kind of a neat town. So I I pulled off the highway into Ithaca {BR} and um it's on the southern shore of lake Cayuga, there's flatland and these hills. And it has {BR} a a very particular microclimate there {BR} which allows hippies to survive. {LG} All the stores have names like "it takes a village" or "hemp unlimited" {BR} {LG} And, and the and the and the children are all completely multiethnic and only wear cloth organic diapers it was {BR} it was really something. I drove around like, sort of like Disney hippie land, just watching it. And then {BR} I drove up the hill, up toward Cornell, which has these stately buildings on the hilltop {BR}. And and as I drove onto the campus, {BR} I had this {BR} stabbing sensation and I suddenly was pierced with a vision {BR} of an alternate universe. {BR} My alternate life. I thought "oh my god, I was supposed to go to Cornell." {LG} "If I had gone to Cornell I would have studied animal behavior, and right now, I'd be a professor of evolutionary biology!" {LG} I'm a professor of evolutionary biology and I've got a wife! {LG} She's got dark hair, she's really smart. And I'm a professor with a  wife and {BR} we've got two kids! {LG} They like to sing. {LG} It was this {BR} completely realized vision of this alternate life, and it looked so good, alternate Ithaca Tom, he'd made these great choices. {BR} It was really working out. And  and I drove around in a in a kind of a wash of nostalgia for this life that I hadn't had. {LG} {BR} {LS} Wow, there's the human ecology center, I did all my grad work there. {LG} And there's this funky cottage that I used to live in when I had six roommates, and we had a chore wheel and {BR} ate brown rice, {BR} {LG} and and there was these gorges that we used to do drum circles in and songs to the goddess and it was {BR} and and there was this woman that looked just like my wife would have looked when I would have met her. {BR} I was overwhelmed by it, I couldn't stand to stay there any longer I {BR} I drove off the campus, I fled Ithaca {BR} and and flew to Tai Chi camp. 

{BR} But alternate Ithaca Tom came with me. {LG} {LS} Now, now at camps I tend to really have a good time, I I laugh a lot, I joke a lot, especially {BR} in Tai Chi camp, with the residents are kind of serious and slow moving {BR}. I I can't help but kind of tease them. And, and in this particular camp, {BR}, uh the teacher {BR} said that we were going to be meditating every morning from seven to eight. {BR} and she was looking for a volunteer, someone, a musician {BR} that would {BR} wander the hallways um playing an instrument or singing to wake up the residents. {BR} I'm not a morning person, {BR} and so I thought, oh, so I have a choice here, either it's gonna be six thirty, I'll be {BR} lying in my bed, really grumpy, {BR} while some asshole sings outside my door, {BR} or, I could be the singing asshole. {LG} For the rest of that week, I was the singing asshole of the camp. {BR} Every morning I would I would roam the halls singing lustily, waiting {BR} waking up all of my fellow {BR} Tai Chi players and {BR} I and and the the people there saw me laughing and singing and they said, Tom, it's really great to have you here, you're so happy, you're such a happy guy, and I thought {BR} yeah, you think I'm happy, but you haven't seen alternate Ithaca Tom! {BR} I've seen him! He's happy! {BR} And and the fact that he was so much happier than me was making me miserable. 

{BR} {LS} And I kept looking at everybody else's life. And and comparing myself to them. And {BR} I remember having lunch with a {BR} a woman who was in her sixties, and she was a calligrapher. {BR} And she was about to have her first grandchild, she was really excited and I thought {LS} {BR} maybe calligraphy {LG} {BR}.   That, that could be it {LG} . And and then there was this other guy, he had studied Tai Chi when he was in his twenties, and now he was a sales rep at Dell {BR} and I thought, dammit! if I had studies Tai Chi in my twenties maybe {BR} I could be a sales rep at Dell now! {BR} I've never wanted to be a sales rep, but I was, {BR}, I was just getting carried away {BR}. That feeling that I was in the wrong life, I was in the wrong place, I couldn't shake it {BR}. I I really tried to absorb the lesson of Tai Chi. Which is {BR} to be present. Just relax, {BR} accept what's coming to you. {BR} And be present here. {BR} But I thought, yeah, yeah, that would be easy it's {BR} so much easier {BR} to accept where you are if only you're in the right place! 

{LG} {BR} Well eventually camp was over and I I left, I drove back to New York, and as I was {BR} driving away over the George Washington Bridge I could still hear alternate Ithaca Tom. He was {BR} hanging around me, haunting me like a ghost, and I thought oh god {BR}, I need professional help. {BR} So I made an appointment with the family psychic {LG} . This is the guy that's done readings for all of my siblings, and my cousins, and I went to see him and {BR} he's an astrologer so he did out my chart and {BR} this time he was very interested in {BR} this polarity that he saw. He said "you have Saturn in the midheaven". And this {BR} marks you as a person who could be very organizational. {BR} The organizational man, the hierarchical one. {BR} Uh the corporate guy. The dad, the provider {BR} . Not particularly sexy but a straight up guy. {LG} {BR} On the other hand, there's pisces and the sun {BR} and they're they're uh they're squared with each other, you can't resolve them, pisces and the dreamer, the mystic {BR} the guy that's {BR} the artist that's never quite pinned down, never quite in a relationship {BR} and and you have to {BR} balance these two, you you have to chose one or the other and {BR} and and normally I love to hear this kind of thing, this is the great thing about going to a psychic, is that {BR} for an hour they just talk about me! {BR} Its, {LG} its so interesting! {BR} {LG} But this time I was so caught up with Alternate Ithaca Tom I couldn't really {BR} appreciate it all. So I I just blurted out what had happened to me, and I asked him {BR} what does this mean? And the psychic said {BR} wow. {LS} This represents a fundamental choice that you've made in your life. {BR} You could have been {BR} the hierarchical guy. But you chose to be the piscean. {BR} If you had decided {BR} to be an academic, you would have been very successful. {BR} There's no doubt that the university structure would have {BR} raised you up, you probably would be married, have kids. I thought aw, shit, alternate Ithaca Tam {BR} made the right choices!! {BR} But the psychic said {BR} if you had become an academic, {BR} your wife would have had an affair with your brother, or your best friend. {LG} {BR} Alternate Ithaca Tom is crushed. {BR} {LG} He's just found out that his wife is having an affair with his research partner! This is the guy he's been working with for fifteen years! {BR} It's a long term affair, they're {BR} they're moving in together, she's taking the kids! {BR} He's completely crushed, poor alternate Ithaca Tom. He {BR} he starts drinking {BR} he can't keep his {BR} lecture notes together, he can't keep his research together he's coming up for tenure and it's all  falling apart, {BR} and in the midst {BR} of his turmoil, he's suddenly {BR} pierced by this vision {BR} of himself, driving a Volkswagen van. {LG} He's off to camp, uh, it's a Tai Chi camp! {LG} He's {BR} he's not married, {BR}, he doesn't have kids! he doesn't even have a job! {BR} He's completely free. It looks so good this image, {BR} it pierces him to his heart {BR} . It begins to hang around him and to haunt him {BR} like a hungry ghost. {LG} {NS}
