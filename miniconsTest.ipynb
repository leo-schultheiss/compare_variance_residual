      "So a lot of people are raised with a religion, and I'm one of those people that was raised with two. {BR} There was our official religion, my family is and I was at the time conservative evangelical christians. {BR} But then there was our unofficial faith and hope we had in Mary Kay cosmetics. {LG} Um {LS} many of the women in my family had been Mary Kay beauty consultants since I was {BR} a child and {BR} I loved Jesus as long as I could remember but that Mary Kay thing was {BR} I was hoping to dodge that bullet. Um I was this brainy grunge girl from Boulder county, I wore {BR} hemp jewelry and clothes from the Salvation army, {BR} I had moral obliga um objections to wearing make up. {BR} And when I got a scholarship to go out of state for college, I thought I'd made my big escape. {BR} But my last visit home, I listened to one recruiting tape too many {LG}, and the logic and reason finally got to me and I signed the dotted line. And I started my business as a Mary Kay beauty consultant. {LG}Now, on paper the business plan looks foolproof. {BR} All you're supposed to need is to have one friend to host a party for you, where you sell skin care and make up to her friends. {BR} Then you're supposed to book two more, every time. {BR} So your datebook is never empty. {BR} But I could never book two more. I used the script, {BR} I thought I was fun to be with, I don't know what the problem was {LG} but luckily for me there was like a hundred other ways they trained us to get bookings, and one of these ways was to strike up seemingly natural conversations with perfect strangers. {LG} And we had {CG} we had a name for this. {LS} We called this warm chatter. {LG} And I thought damnit, I'm gonna rock this, I'm gonna be the queen of warm chatter. {BR} So what I'm about to tell you, I did this um for very long time, about two three days a week for two or three hours a day. {LS} I would get {BR} dressed up in my business suit, {BR} and I'd put on all my make up and I'd pack my bag full of samples and I would drive to Target. {BR} And in Target I would get my red shopping cart and I'd pretend I was shopping for items, but really {LS} I was just hunting for women. {BR} I was um {LG} I was looking for women who looked cute or friendly or approachable, {BR} when I found somebody like this then I would just {BR} discretely follow her through the store {LG}, until we could be together in an aisle alone {BR} {LG}. And then, {LG} I would appear to just be walking by normally, {BR} and I would slow down and in the most casual way possible, I would say these words that I'd rehearsed a hundred million times. {LS} I would say: {BR} excuse me, can I ask you a quick question? {BR} I'm Jen with Mary Kay, {BR} and we just came out with a new line of lip glosses, and I need some women to {??WTF is this word? can't make it out for the life of me} of it. You know, I have some samples here in my bag. {BR} Is there any reason why you wouldn't want to take one home and try it? {BR} And this part was really important, we were trained to smile and nod while we asked the question. It has to do with nonverbal communication and mirroring, it's very advanced. {BR} {LG} And um, {LG} and if she said yes I'd give her the sample I'd get her phone number when I called her back later to thank her {BR} I would offer her a complimentary appointment with me. {BR} And I wouldn't mention that all my appointments were complimentary cause it just didn't seem important. {LG}. So at the same time I was doing this for my career {BR} my husband and I were also leading helping to lead programs for our local church. {BR} And this is the kind of church that was trying to be hip and modern. It met in a strip mall, {BR} and we had a rock band {LG} a rock band leading our ship up front. {LS} The pastor was this forty something british guy and he really wanted to attract twenty somethings so we were a hot commodity. We were right in the demographic. {BR} And we started to get promoted up into higher and higher echelons of leadership. {BR} So we were invited to the leadership team meeting and then the core leadership team meeting. {BR} And I still remember my first night at one of these meetings. And {LS} don't know exactly what I was expecting, {BR} but I think I'd always imagined them to be kind of soulful events, {BR} and I was really dismayed to show up and discover it was this really tedious conversation about {BR} branding and marketing and what the church's next advertising campaign was going to be. {BR} So it didn't take too long before these two worlds, the church and Mary Kay's, started to look more and more similar. {LG} And {LG} they both had the lure. In Mary Kay it was giving out free samples, {BR} but at the church we were having free events to try and get people in the doors. {BR} In both worlds we were couching everything we did inside a conversation about service. {BR} So Mary Kay's company tagline at the time was {BR} Changing women's lives. {LS} Which if you think about it isn't that different from saving people's souls. {LG} And um and we really we really believed it, we really thought we were doing this, even though nobody's motives are that pure. {BR} And in both worlds I was being trained all the time to listen to people everywhere I went for whatever was missing or not working about their life, {BR} and offer what we had as the solution. {LS} So if you needed {BR} time or money or flexibility, {BR} Mary Kay might be perfect for you! {BR} But if you're struggling with your marriage or you've had a recent loss, {BR} maybe you're questioning the meaning of life, call me crazy but have you considered maybe Jesus is the answer? {LG} And soon I just started to feel like a twenty four hour saleswoman, and it started to get confusing like which hat I was wearing at which time. {LS} Until {BR} one day I was in Target with my little red cart, {BR} and I saw this lovely looking redhead who smiled so big when I smiled at her, {BR} and I started into my script \"Excuse me can I ask you a quick question?\" {BR} Except this time it started to sound a little flat, like those pull string dolls that sound kind of wonky at the end. {BR} And um suddenly I was just thinking, does she need Mary Kay or does she need Jesus? {LG} Does she need Mary Kay or does she need Jesus?  {LG} And {LG} I don't know which one I offered her but she said no. {LG} Because {LG} I was acting crazy. {LG} Um {LG} and she turned and walked away. And I realized the problem with {BR} whenever you have something whether it's a religion or business or anything else that you think is the right answer for everybody, through that lens you can't help but look at everyone in the world as if they're broken, and need to be fixed. And I didn't want to do that anymore. So I put my cart away at the front of the store and I drove home. {BR} The next night was my weekly success meeting. {BR} And the director was up front telling us giving us all the information about the new lipstick formula, {BR} and the changed that were being made. {BR} And I start to look around the room at these women, {BR} and they're either my friends who I'd like recruited in to  it or my relatives who had recruited me into it, and I was thinking about {BR} how devastating it would be when I quit. Because I wasn't just {BR} rejecting everything they stood for, {BR} but I was letting down my friends, I'd gotten them into it, I was bailing on them, and then {BR} my relatives, the people who'd recruited me, their income depended on me, {BR} their income, their status, all of our fortunes were tied in together. {BR} And I thought but is this really changing women's lives the way I hoped it would? {BR} And the director started passing around mirrors and lipstick samples for us to try it ourselves. {BR} And I thought no, I don't think so anymore. {BR} And a couple days later was the church leadership meeting. And the pastor was telling us that {BR} the Church's new mission statement needed to have five points, one for every finger on the hand, so people could remember it. {BR} And I started looking around this room and thinking about what they would think about me when I quit. {BR} They would think I was backsliding and falling off the wagon. But it was even worse than that. They would think I was going to hell, that my children were going to hell, and if I was wrong maybe they would be right. {BR} And I thought but is this really saving people's souls, this? All this that we're doing. And the pastor interrupted to say {BR} that all five points needed to start with the same letter. {LG} And I thought, no. {LG} I don't think so anymore. {LG} And so that was when I stopped trying to save the world and I decided to save myself instead from this life I didn't want anymore. {BR} And it, it really cost me. I lost my identity, I lost belonging, {BR} I lost the ability to ever be that certain or righteous about anything ever again. {LS} And if you can imagine what it's like {BR} to lose a faith, and then imagine what it's like to lose two at once. Because even though Mary Kay was a business, it wasn't just that. It was a way I thought the world worked. {BR} It was the way I thought that we could all win, and everybody could get what they needed. {BR} It was really devastating. I felt like I might not ever be able to trust myself again. {BR} The last piece of our exit strategy was {BR} our move to New York. We were going to get {BR} geographic distance, start fresh someplace else. {BR} We landed in Brooklyn, in a neighborhood called Park Slope. And everywhere we went, {BR} people were either trying to recruit us into or warn us against joining the Park Slope Food Coop. {LG} And {LG} it seems so unobjectionable. You know. Like who can argue against cheap organic environmentally friendly food, community run? And part of me was really tempted because I thought I can have my identity back. Everyone will know I'm a good person. {LG} {BR} And I can belong again. But there was something about the way that the people we talked to were just so convinced it was the right thing for everybody, {BR} that felt creepily familiar. And I thought {BR} I know where that path leads. {LG} So when one particularly zealous friend cornered me one day, {BR} and said are you gonna join or not? Are you in or are you out? {LG} Just took a deep breath {BR} and I looked her in the eyes, and I said {BR} sorry I don't do religions anymore. Thank you. {NS} \n",

      "I reached over and secretly undid my seatbelt, and when his foot hit the brake at the red light {BR} , I flung open the door {BR}, and I ran. I had no shoes on, I was crying, {BR} I had no wallet, but I was OK because I had my cigarettes. {LG} And I didn't want any part of freedom if I didn't have my cigarettes. {BR} When you live with someone who has a temper - a very bad temper, a very, very bad temper, {BR} you learn to play around that. {BR} You learn {BR} \"this time I'll play possum\" {BR} and \"next time I'll just be real nice\" or {BR} \"I'll say yes to everything\" or {BR} you make yourself scarce or you run. And this was one of the times when you just run. {BR} And as I was running I thought this was a great place to jump out, {BR} because there were big lawns and there were cul de sacs {BR} and sometimes he would come after me and drive and yell stuff at me, {BR} to get back in, get back in, {BR} and I was like \"no, I'm out of here\".  {BR} This is great, and I went and hid behind a cabana and he left. {LS} And I had my cigarettes. {BR} And uh {BR} I started to walk in this beautiful neighborhood. It was ten thirty at night. {BR} And {BR} it was silent. And lovely. And there was no sound except for sprinklers. {BR} Ch ch ch ch brrrrrrrr ch ch ch ch brrrrrrrr. {BR} And I was enjoying myself and enjoying the absence of anger and enjoying these few hours I knew I'd have of freedom. {BR} And just to perfect it, I thought, \"I'll have a smoke\", {BR} and then it occurred to me, with horrifying speed, \"I don't have a light!\" {LG} Just then, as if in answer, I see a figure up ahead, who is that? It's not him, OK. {BR} They don't have a dog, who is that? What uh what are they doing out on this suburban street? {BR} And the person comes closer and I could see it's a woman {LS} and then I can see {BR} she has her hands in her face. Oh she's crying. {BR} And then she sees me and she composes herself, {BR} and she gets closer, and I see she has no shoes on. {BR} She has no shoes on and she's crying and she's out on the street street. I recognize her, though I've never met her. {BR} And just as she passes me she says {BR} \"you got a cigarette?\" And I say \"you got a light?\" {LG} And she says \"damn I hope so.\" {BR} And then sh first she digs into her cutoffs in the front, nothing, {BR} and then digs in the back and then she has this vest on that has {BR} fifty million little pockets on it and she's checking and checking and it's looking bad, it's looking very bad. {BR} She digs back in the front again, deep, deep, and she pulls out a pack of matches that had been laundered at least once. {LG} Eck.We open it up and there is one match inside. {BR} OK. Oh my god. {BR} This takes on - it's like NASA now, we got to like, oh how are we gonna do it, {BR} OK, and we we hunker down, {BR} we crouch on the ground, and, \"where's the wind coming from?\" We're stopping, {BR} I take out my cigarettes, let's get the cigarettes ready. \"Oh, my brand,\" she says, not surprising. {BR} And we both have our cigarettes at the ready. {BR} She strikes once, nothing. She strikes again, yes! Fire, {BR} puff, inhale. Mm, sweet kiss of that cigarette. {BR} And we sit there, and we're loving the nicotine, and we both need this right now. I can tell the night's been tough. {BR} {LS}Immediately we start to reminisce about our thirty second relationship. \"I didn't think that was going to happen!\" \"Me neither!\" \"Oh man that was close!\" {BR} \"Oh I'm so lucky I saw you!\" \"Yeah!\" {LG} {LS} Then she surprises me by saying \"what was the fight about?\" {LS} And I say \"wha what are they all about?\" And she said \"I know what you mean\". {BR} She said \"was it a bad one?\" And I said \"you know, like medium.\" {LS} She said \"oh\" {BR} and we start to trade stories about our lives. {LS} We're both from up north, we're both kind of newish to the neighborhood (this is in Florida), {BR} we both went to college, not great colleges, but man we graduated. {LS} And I'm actually finding myself a little jealous of her because she has this really cool job {BR} washing dogs. {BR} {LG} She had horses back home and she really loves animals and she wants to be a vet and I'm like \"man you're halfway there!\" {LG} {LG} {LS} I'm a waitress at an ice cream parlor so um that's not I don't know where I want to be but I know it's not that. And then it gets a little deeper, and we share some other stuff about what our lives are like. {BR} Things that I can't ever tell people at home. {BR} This girl, I can tell her the really ugly stuff, and she still understands how it can still be pretty. She understands like, how nice he's gonna be when I get home, and how sweet that'll be. {BR} {LS}We are chain smoking off each other. \"Oh, that's almost out, come on!\" And we we go through this entire pack until it's gone {LS} and then I say, \"you know what uh this is a little funny but you're gonna have to show me the way to get home. Because although I'm twenty three years old I don't have my driver's license yet {LS} and I just jumped out right when I needed to.\" {BR} And she says \"well why don't you come back to my house and I'll give you a ride?\" I say \"OK great!\" {LS} and we start walking. And uh, we get to this, um, lots of, uh, lights, and uh the roads are getting wider and wider and there's more cars {BR} and I see um lots of stores, you know laundromats and dollar stores and emergecenters and then we cross over US one and uh she leads me to some place and I think \"no!\" {BR} But yes. Carl's efficiency apartments. This girl lives there. And it's horrible and it's lit up so bright, just to illuminate the horribleness of it. {BR} It's the kind of place where you drive your car right up and the door's right there {BR} and there's fifty million cigarette butts outside {BR} and there's like doors one through seven and you know behind every single door there's some horrible misery going on. There's someone crying or drunk or lonely or cruel. {BR} And I think \"oh god she lives here, how awful.\" {BR} We go to the door, door number four, and she very, very quietly keys in. {LS} {BR} As soon as the door opens I hear the blare of television come out and on the blue light of the television {BR} the smoke of a hundred cigarettes in that little crack of light. And I hear the man and he says, \"where were you?\" And she says, \"never mind, I'm back.\" And he says, \"you alright?\" And she says, \"yeah I'm alright.\" {BR} And then she turns to me and says, \"you want a beer?\" And he says, \"who the fuck is that?\" {BR} And she pulls me over and he sees me and he says \"oh, hey\". I'm not a threat. {LS} {BR} Just then he takes a drag of his cigarette, a very hard hard drag, you know the kind that makes the end of it really heat up hot hot hot {BR} and long and it's a little scary {BR} and I follow the cigarette down because I'm afraid of that head falling off, {BR} and I'm surprised when I see, in the crook of his arm, a little boy, sleeping. A toddler. And I think {BR}. And just then the girl reaches underneath the bed and takes out a carton and she taps out the last s pack of cigarettes in there, {BR} and on the way up she kisses the little boy, and then she kisses the man, and the man says again, \"you alright?\" And she says, \"yeah, I'm just going to go out and smoke with her.\" And so we go outside and sit amongst the cigarette butts and smoke. And I say, \"wow, that's your little boy?\" {BR} And she says, \"yeah isn't he beautiful?\" And I say, \"yeah he is, he is beautiful.\" {BR} \"He's my light, he keeps me going,\" she says. {LS} {BR} We finish our cigarettes, she finishes her beer. I don't have a beer cause I can't go home with beer on my breath. {LS} {BR} And she goes inside to get the keys. {LS}  {BR} She takes too long in there getting the keys and I think something must be wrong and she comes out and she says, \"look, {BR} I'm really sorry, but um, {BR} like we don't have any gas in the car, it's already on E and he needs to get to work in the morning and um {LS} I you know I I'm gonna be walk to work as it is so what I did was though here look I drew out this map for you, and you're really, you're like a mile and a half from home, {BR} and um if you walk three streets over you'll be back on that pretty street, and you just take that and you'll be fine.\" {BR} And she also {BR} has wrapped up in toilet paper seven cigarettes for me. {LS} A third of her pack, I note. And a new pack of matches. And she tells me good bye and that was great to meet you and how lucky and that was fun and, you know. Let's be friends. And I say, \"yeah, ok\" {BR} and I walk away {BR} but I kind of know we're not going to be friends. {LS} I might not ever see her again. And I kind of know, I don't think she's ever going to be a vet. And I cross, and I walk away. {BR} And maybe this would've seemed like a visit from my possible future and scary, but it kind of does the opposite. On the walk home I'm like, man, {BR} that was really grim over there. And I'm going home now to my nice boyfriend and he is gonna be so extra happy to see me. And {BR} we have a one bedroom apartment, and we have two trees, and there's a yard, {BR} and we have this jar in the kitchen where there's like loose money that we can use for anything like we would never ever run out of gas, {BR} and um I don't have a baby. You know? So I can leave whenever I want. {BR} I smoked all seven cigarettes on the way home. {BR} And people who have never smoked cigarettes just think ick, disgusting, and poison. But unless you've had them, {BR} and held them dear, you don't know how great they can be. {BR} And what friends and comfort and kinship they can bring. It took me a long time to quit that boyfriend. And then to quit smoking. {BR} And uh, sometimes I still miss the smoking. {NS}\n",

      "Under the influence is our topic tonight, and uh I I thought of a lot of different things. And and the one I kinda wanted to talk about was {BR} my secret influence. Um {LS} there are people in our lives that are {BR} incredibly important to us and {BR} I would even mention to say some of the most important people, everybody aside from my mother, in my life, {BR} doesn't know anything about this person, {BR} who I think about every day. And his name was Michael Marquis. So {BR} if this were a violin piece it would be called Ode to Michael Marquis. {BR} Um {BR} {LS} I met him when I was seven years old, {LS} and {BR} I was growing up uh my {LS} mother had left my father when I was about two or three {BR} and this was the first man {LS} that my mother had brought home, like, for me to meet. {LS} {BR} and {LS} uh he was a Vietnam vet, {LS} he was {BR} a professional athlete, ah, he had played {BR} college football, college baseball, he was uh a ski instructor and a golf instructor {BR} uh he had like a big beard and he drank Scotch and he had a German Shepherd and he had a lab {BR} and he had this unbelievable M. G. {BR} and not like those little like wussy M. G. s that you see like it was like a nineteen thirty three M. G. it was like a motorcycle. I mean, this thing was {BR} so cool and the doors like went super low {LG} you know I mean it was like so cool {BR} . And he was so cool. {BR} And {LS} he was the first person {BR} to really tap into um {LS} {BR} he may have tapped into it, he may have created it, I'm not sure but a momma's boy complex. Um. {BR} which was that I had uh {BR} I hadn't been my my father lived in Texas, and I hadn't been to Texas since I was about three. {BR} But I was obsessed, I had a Dallas Cowboys belt buckle, {LS} {BR} I would wear, like you know um {LS} uh flower t-shirts, you know, like Grant Parson's or something like that, I mean this is {LG} about nineteen seventy seven I was very into that I only listened to Willy Nelson's the red headed stranger. {BR} Um {LS} my room was covered with cowboys and broncos and indians and {BR} {LS} like anything Texas was up my alley. {BR} And he met me and he's like, why what's all the Texas stuff? you know? {BR} I was like, well, you know, my dad lives in Texas. Well. He ain't here, is he? I'm like, nah. He's like, well I think I'd get over the Texas thing if I were you. {LG} {BR} I'd be like, you know, that really hurt my feelings. And {BR} and he he proceeded to like latch into this thing, like, so wait, you a momma's boy? Cowboys lost today, did your dad call? {NS} No. Right {NS} He's he's very tough guy. Very tough guy. {BR} {LS} Um {BR} and and through uh a little bit of, what what my mother felt was kind of abusive behavior, {LG} um {LG} uh I I grew to love him, {LG} right. I mean I hated him, {BR} but I loved him, I I I thought about him all the time, and what he would think about something and {BR} like uh for example, he decided that since I was so into football, {BR} uh but you don't know how to play football! You know? What name, no, any did your dad teach you to play football? No I don't think he did, did he? {LG} Alright, come on, let's play football! {BR} No, it's, I'm not looking for the pity thing. It's pretty funny. I mean he was a funny guy, he {BR} he was trying to help me, in his own weird way. {BR} So he takes me outside, {LS} he takes me outside, and he uh {BR} he says uh, alright, I'm gonna teach you how to play football. Alright? But football is a man's game, it's not a momma's boy's game. Alright? you put you you make a diamond, with your hands, your thumb to your forefingers, {BR} and if you can touch it, you can catch it. So I'm like, alright. {LG} bam! you know, and I'm {LG} He's like, you still with me, you still wanna play football? {LG} huh? I'm like, yeah, I wanna play football. He's like, alright! If you can touch it, you can catch it. {LS} bam! You know, and it this went on, and and it was freezing outside, {BR} {LS} and um and my nose is bleeding and um {LS} I'm crying and I want to go inside, and {BR} he's like, you know, you gotta catch this football. alright. And so finally I catch it like three times. He's like, alright! See, you're not such a little momma's boy after all {BR} and I feel kind of good about myself. {LG} I mean, you know, {LG} go figure, you know. So {LS} my mom really liked him, {LS} and um {BR} we moved to Vermont, and he took us, and he moved us into this one bedroom one no it was just a one room cabin in Vermont. Where uh he got this gig uh as a ski instructor. {BR} and um {LS} and {BR} it was really, picturesque, and he really had it in his heart like uh {BR} to teach me how to be a man. You know. We would {BR} he taught me how to chop wood, and {BR} he bought me um a jeans jacket and he would have my mom do like {BR} patches on the back. You know, and it was really very cool, and I started to feel very cool. He {BR} he took me to see um {BR} the man who would be king, {LG} um, {BR} {LS}, and {LS} uh you know I cr I cried at the end, which was ah, this is a digression, I'm going to regret doing this, but {BR} but it's my favorite line and since I have an audience I have to tell you, it's like {BR} Sean Connery is standing on the burning bridge and and Michael Cain is shot, he's the bridge is burning, he's gonna die. And Michael Cain scouts out, you know {BR}, Peachy, will you ever forgive me for being so bleedin stupid and so bloody arrogant? And Sean Connery says you know {BR} That I can, and that I do. {LG} so like {LG} {NS} Michael and I sat there and I just cried and he was just like pull yourself together, man! {LG} you know? We got in the car, he's got his little M. G., and it's like freezing and I'm crying and he's like, come on! {LG} It was a good movie! It was sad, but it was, you know, you gotta {LG} you know, I loved it too! I loved it too. {LG} But like from then on in my mind, like Michael and I were {LS} you know Michael Cain and Sean Connery on adventures and things and we we had them. You know. I mean, I {BR} \tI had to walk I mean it's really kind of picturesque, I had to walk like two miles to school, and I was only in second grade, and {BR} it was very fun, he insisted that I do it {BR} you know by myself and my my mother has a lot of problems with it. LIke the the the like when my mother would go, she had to go out of town a couple times and he would take me on dates with other women and like, if you tell your mother, I'm gonna kick your ass {LG} . And uh but I thought it was great, I mean again, like you keep being judgmental, and I I was like I was like this guy is so cool. {LG} And uh I remember I like rolled uh joints for him for this other girl. I have, I don't know I have this vague memory of it but {BR} {LG} um uh, and finally like my most pivotal memory of him aside from the closing of my story, uh {BR} is uh is we had you know this little one room cabin. I mean it was really really idyllic. Snow in Vermont and all this other stuff, and {BR} and Michael, we're out on this little deck outside, and Michael's like, see, look at that buck! look at that buck! OK. Get the shotgun. Get the shotgun. You know, I'm like I'm like what for? He's like I'm gonna kill it! {LG} And I'm like I'm like I'm like, mom! Michael's gonna kill a buck, Michael's gonna kill a buck! Michael goes hell {BR} {LS} I was gonna let you shoot it. {LG} You blew it. You know? {BR} and I didn't know how I felt, cause I didn't want to shoot it, but now I felt like, I should have wanted to shoot it. And like, {BR} I don't know, I felt very strange. {LS} Doesn't exactly make sense but you can understand subconscious very influenced. {BR} Um {LG} And so finally one day I come walking home from school, this little cabin, and all my mother's underwear {LS} and lingerie kind of like things {BR} are nailed to the outside of the house. {LG} right. {LG} This is a true story, alright. {BR} And I'm like wow, that's weird. {LG} You know. {LG} And and and uh and inside there's like RA RA RA RA RA RA RA you know, du du du ba ba {BR} and um {LS} uh you know, we basically get in the car and we're gone. And uh we move to Atlanta, Georgia. {BR} {LS} And um you know I don't know any more about what happened there than you do. I mean {LG} lingerie, fighting, I don't I can guess, you know, but {LG} I've never asked my mom, my mom has a lot of issues. {LS} But that's not, this is Michael's Ode {BR} . Um and so anyway, we move to Atlanta, Georgia, and {LS} what happens is my father uh {BR} gets remarried and for some reason {BR} to my now eight year old mind {BR} {LS} this is very disturbing. Um {BR} I'm not invited to the wedding and I'm very upset about this and and {BR} it it it's kind of throwing my whole Texas fantasy scheme a a apart {BR} and I get {LS} uh but I'm I'm in this like weird school in Atlanta Georgia and I actually get accepted to like this a this um little gifted and talented program. Like for an eight year old, right. And I I go to {BR} . And I get kicked out on the second day, cause I tells, told some kid that his painting sucked. {LG} Right? {LG} Or the teacher uh uh I didn't get kicked out right away {BR} uh uh I had to write a one page essay {LS} about why {LS} um I would you know about I was supposed to write about why {BR} saying somebody's painting sucked was a bad thing. {BR} And I wrote in my essay that {LS} I didn't know that it was something bad, because {BR} my mother goes out with lots of guys, and {LS} the last one that she dated, {BR} told me I sucked all the time, {BR} and I didn't think it was that big a deal. Now {BR} that that that sounds like, the truth is I knew exactly what I was doing. Like and it wasn't like {BR} it I was trying to make my mom look bad in front of the teachers, to like deflect um you know me being in trouble. I my mom was so angry at me. She hone like like she gets this call, from this and she hangs up, she's like yeah yeah yeah you little shit. You know? {LG} We uh I don't date lots of guys {BR} . And Michael didn't say you sucked. Yes he did. Alright he did. But {LG} you know like, bla bla {LG} {LS} And um {LS} anyway the point is, and then I got in a fight, I got kicked out of this gifted and talented thing, it was like a big deal, and my {BR} father was getting remarried and they sent me to a child psychologist and {BR} and my mom comes up with this idea that she's gonna invite {LS} Michael to come to my birthday. Like that I I could really use this, right {BR} . But I don't know about this. But so my birthday arrives. {BR} And we're living in Atlanta, Georgia now {BR} and who comes down the street in a little M. G. with a golden retriever right on the side thing and his {BR} hair and his beard and he's got this, you know thing, and a bunch of presents in the back {BR} he comes pulling up. {BR} And it it was really one of the greatest moments of my li, I mean I was so happy to see him. {BR} And I had all these boys come over {BR} um for my birthday party, {BR} and Michael took turns taking us around the block and he would like peel out, fishtail around the thing and {BR} {LG} and my mother would be screaming Michael {NS} and all the boys would be like, your dad is so cool. {LG} And I'd be like, I know. I know {LG} He's so cool. {BR} And I I was just it was really one of those glorious days. Michael took us all to Chuck E Cheese's, and we went to see George Burns in Oh God, {BR} {LG} and like {LG} and everybody was just so into Michael. And I by you know association was a very studly guy. {BR} And Um {LS} and so then it's, the night's over, {LS} and uh Michael's gonna leave. You know, Michael says, goodbye! I say, alright, see you later. {BR} And he starts to go. And I go to my room, and I start sobbing. Right. And um {LS} and {BR} and so my mother comes in, and is like, what are, what are you crying about? Like nothing, nothing. You know I just {BR} I wish Michael was gonna stay longer. You know {BR} . And she's like uh alright. And she goes outside. {BR} And {NS} {LS} Uh. Ok, but yeah go go go {LG} {LS} Um {LG} and uh it's very good, very good timing, very good timing. um. {LG} {LS} Like Pat Riley would s Pat Riley would say, it's all good. {LS} Um {LG} mm mm so much for him. {BR} uh {LG} {LS} but uh {BR} so Michael come into my room. {BR} and I'm devastated. Uh because as much as I would like and everything for him to talk to me, and everything {BR} I am so upset you know and I I really don't want him to see me like this. You know. And {BR} and he tells me, uh, that you know he's you know he's gonna stay in touch with me, and that {BR} don't worry you know my mom's a pain in the ass, we all know that, {BR} but uh I'm gonna stay in touch with you, you're a great kid, you know and {BR} he might have even told me he loved me, he was really being really nice. I mean he drove from Vermont to Georgia for a day. Um {BR} and uh {LS} and so {BR} so and then he leaves. And you know like I watch him drive away, it's like night now. And I watch the M. G. and the golden retriever like {NS}, {BR} take off, and and my mom comes back in the house, I hear it. And I just {BR} scream out of the room. Like I am never gonna speak to you again. You know. I I I felt so betrayed by her, because if Michael was gonna leave, I wanted him to think I didn't care. You know. {BR} And {LS} he and I never saw him again. {LS} you know. And uh I got a message, my mother got a message about {BR} two or three years ago or something that uh that uh she googled Michael Marquis. No she didn't. Uh {LG} uh, that uh {BR} she she had heard from him, and that like he saw some movie I did and thought I was doing really great and {BR} really meant a lot to me, because uh {BR} you know uh, nobody I know knows him but I carry him with me {LS}. Every day. {LS} And uh, {BR} he's been the secret influence of my life. {NS} Thank you.\n",

      "There're some scientists who say that the universe that we inhabit {BR} is not the only universe there is. {BR} There are alternate universes. {BR} They say that these universes arise {BR} from the sub atomic realm of quantum physics. Here's how they say it works. {BR} Every time a quantum event happens, {BR}, it produces all of its possible results. This is like saying if you flip a coin {BR} it comes up heads, but it also comes up tails. {BR} Since those two results are mutually exclusive, {BR} the flipping of the coin splits the Universe {BR} into two alternate universes {BR}. The \"heads\" universe, and the \"tails\" universe {BR}. And since quantum events are happening all the time, {BR}, it means that alternate universes {BR} are bubbling up continually, they're always being created, splitting off from ours {BR}. And these alternate universes {BR} are real, they're not just figments of the imagination {BR}. They're complete, whole, real things. I know this is true, {BR} because I experienced an alternate universe. {LG} {LS} I was driving in my volkswagen van, {BR} up to a Tai Chi camp, in upstate New York a couple of summers ago. {BR} Um I bought the Volkswagen van when I'd quit my job a few years previously {BR} . I bought the van um because I quit the job as a custom database application engineer. {BR} This was not a job that I really had intended to become, when I was a kid, that's not what I thought I was going to be {BR}. Uh it's just sort of the job I happened into, and I always thought of it as the work I was doing before I was gonna find my real work. {BR} But when I got close to about forty, I suddenly thought \"oh my god, this could be it\". {BR} This could be what I end up doing, this could be on my tombstone. {BR} Tom Wiser, custom database application engineer. {LG} {BR} Wrote well optimized queries. {LG} Many customers satisfied. {LG} {BR} And I thought, no, that that can't be, it, that can't be all there is. And I quit the job, {BR} without really knowing what I was going to do next, and {BR} and and I knew that what I should do was to take my skill set {BR}, and to make a lateral move to a career path that was more appropriate, but {BR} but I I I really didn't want to do that. I didn't want to be so logical. I actually wanted something more {BR} magic. I {BR} I wanted to be like the guy in the fairy tale that {BR} trades the cow for the magic beans. {BR} and and I know that that's a bad deal, I know {BR} that the cow's a better investment. {BR} {LG} The cow's gonna pay off in the long term, but but {BR} but but if the magic beans work out, {BR} you're in a whole new story. {BR} So {LG} so so I quit the job and I bought a Volkswagen pop top camper van. {BR} And I drove around country in what I thought was, OK. {BR} I'm not going to make a lateral move, I am  going to drive around the country, and I'm gonna open myself up to whatever may come, and then what I'm going to do {BR} is going to arise organically {BR} I'm gonna find my next path there {BR} by the side of the road in Arizona, I'm gonna pick it up, and bring it back to New York. {BR} So, I drove around the country. {BR} Twenty five thousand miles, eight months. {BR} And when I got back to New York {LS} I had no clue. {LG} I really didn't know, and and it left me very vulnerable {BR} to the New York question. {BR} The first question that anybody asks. Which is, \"so what do you do?\" {LG} I didn't know. I had, I had I didn't have a good answer and it made me feel really embarrassed because {BR} everybody knows what they do, everybody does, and I thought I should, too. {BR}. So when I was driving the Volkswagen van up to Tai Chi camp,  the other summer, I I felt very relieved because in camp, I know what I do. {BR} I do the camp thing. I do what's at camp and {BR} I don't know if you know this, but there are a lot of camps for adults that are out there. I I found them when I was driving around the country {BR}. There are Tai Chi camps and Yoga camps and {BR} and bird watching camps. There's even a camp where you can dress up in armor and joust. {LG} {LS} {BR} All the things that that give us joy and that we tend to demean with the name hobby. {BR} Those are the things that are that are celebrated in camp. {BR} And when people go to camp they are so lit up, they are finally getting to do that thing, the thing they love, it's like \"yes, {BR} I finally get to joust, I don't have time for that anymore {BR} really.\" {LG} So I was going up to camp and feeling pretty good about it and I decided {BR} on the way I would stop into Ithaca. {BR} I heard it was kind of a neat town. So I I pulled off the highway into Ithaca {BR} and um it's on the southern shore of lake Cayuga, there's flatland and these hills. And it has {BR} a a very particular microclimate there {BR} which allows hippies to survive. {LG} All the stores have names like \"it takes a village\" or \"hemp unlimited\" {BR} {LG} And, and the and the and the children are all completely multiethnic and only wear cloth organic diapers it was {BR} it was really something. I drove around like, sort of like Disney hippie land, just watching it. And then {BR} I drove up the hill, up toward Cornell, which has these stately buildings on the hilltop {BR}. And and as I drove onto the campus, {BR} I had this {BR} stabbing sensation and I suddenly was pierced with a vision {BR} of an alternate universe. {BR} My alternate life. I thought \"oh my god, I was supposed to go to Cornell.\" {LG} \"If I had gone to Cornell I would have studied animal behavior, and right now, I'd be a professor of evolutionary biology!\" {LG} I'm a professor of evolutionary biology and I've got a wife! {LG} She's got dark hair, she's really smart. And I'm a professor with a  wife and {BR} we've got two kids! {LG} They like to sing. {LG} It was this {BR} completely realized vision of this alternate life, and it looked so good, alternate Ithaca Tom, he'd made these great choices. {BR} It was really working out. And  and I drove around in a in a kind of a wash of nostalgia for this life that I hadn't had. {LG} {BR} {LS} Wow, there's the human ecology center, I did all my grad work there. {LG} And there's this funky cottage that I used to live in when I had six roommates, and we had a chore wheel and {BR} ate brown rice, {BR} {LG} and and there was these gorges that we used to do drum circles in and songs to the goddess and it was {BR} and and there was this woman that looked just like my wife would have looked when I would have met her. {BR} I was overwhelmed by it, I couldn't stand to stay there any longer I {BR} I drove off the campus, I fled Ithaca {BR} and and flew to Tai Chi camp. {BR} But alternate Ithaca Tom came with me. {LG} {LS} Now, now at camps I tend to really have a good time, I I laugh a lot, I joke a lot, especially {BR} in Tai Chi camp, with the residents are kind of serious and slow moving {BR}. I I can't help but kind of tease them. And, and in this particular camp, {BR}, uh the teacher {BR} said that we were going to be meditating every morning from seven to eight. {BR} and she was looking for a volunteer, someone, a musician {BR} that would {BR} wander the hallways um playing an instrument or singing to wake up the residents. {BR} I'm not a morning person, {BR} and so I thought, oh, so I have a choice here, either it's gonna be six thirty, I'll be {BR} lying in my bed, really grumpy, {BR} while some asshole sings outside my door, {BR} or, I could be the singing asshole. {LG} For the rest of that week, I was the singing asshole of the camp. {BR} Every morning I would I would roam the halls singing lustily, waiting {BR} waking up all of my fellow {BR} Tai Chi players and {BR} I and and the the people there saw me laughing and singing and they said, Tom, it's really great to have you here, you're so happy, you're such a happy guy, and I thought {BR} yeah, you think I'm happy, but you haven't seen alternate Ithaca Tom! {BR} I've seen him! He's happy! {BR} And and the fact that he was so much happier than me was making me miserable. {BR} {LS} And I kept looking at everybody else's life. And and comparing myself to them. And {BR} I remember having lunch with a {BR} a woman who was in her sixties, and she was a calligrapher. {BR} And she was about to have her first grandchild, she was really excited and I thought {LS} {BR} maybe calligraphy {LG} {BR}.   That, that could be it {LG} . And and then there was this other guy, he had studied Tai Chi when he was in his twenties, and now he was a sales rep at Dell {BR} and I thought, dammit! if I had studies Tai Chi in my twenties maybe {BR} I could be a sales rep at Dell now! {BR} I've never wanted to be a sales rep, but I was, {BR}, I was just getting carried away {BR}. That feeling that I was in the wrong life, I was in the wrong place, I couldn't shake it {BR}. I I really tried to absorb the lesson of Tai Chi. Which is {BR} to be present. Just relax, {BR} accept what's coming to you. {BR} And be present here. {BR} But I thought, yeah, yeah, that would be easy it's {BR} so much easier {BR} to accept where you are if only you're in the right place! {LG} {BR} Well eventually camp was over and I I left, I drove back to New York, and as I was {BR} driving away over the George Washington Bridge I could still hear alternate Ithaca Tom. He was {BR} hanging around me, haunting me like a ghost, and I thought oh god {BR}, I need professional help. {BR} So I made an appointment with the family psychic {LG} . This is the guy that's done readings for all of my siblings, and my cousins, and I went to see him and {BR} he's an astrologer so he did out my chart and {BR} this time he was very interested in {BR} this polarity that he saw. He said \"you have Saturn in the midheaven\". And this {BR} marks you as a person who could be very organizational. {BR} The organizational man, the hierarchical one. {BR} Uh the corporate guy. The dad, the provider {BR} . Not particularly sexy but a straight up guy. {LG} {BR} On the other hand, there's pisces and the sun {BR} and they're they're uh they're squared with each other, you can't resolve them, pisces and the dreamer, the mystic {BR} the guy that's {BR} the artist that's never quite pinned down, never quite in a relationship {BR} and and you have to {BR} balance these two, you you have to chose one or the other and {BR} and and normally I love to hear this kind of thing, this is the great thing about going to a psychic, is that {BR} for an hour they just talk about me! {BR} Its, {LG} its so interesting! {BR} {LG} But this time I was so caught up with Alternate Ithaca Tom I couldn't really {BR} appreciate it all. So I I just blurted out what had happened to me, and I asked him {BR} what does this mean? And the psychic said {BR} wow. {LS} This represents a fundamental choice that you've made in your life. {BR} You could have been {BR} the hierarchical guy. But you chose to be the piscean. {BR} If you had decided {BR} to be an academic, you would have been very successful. {BR} There's no doubt that the university structure would have {BR} raised you up, you probably would be married, have kids. I thought aw, shit, alternate Ithaca Tam {BR} made the right choices!! {BR} But the psychic said {BR} if you had become an academic, {BR} your wife would have had an affair with your brother, or your best friend. {LG} {BR} Alternate Ithaca Tom is crushed. {BR} {LG} He's just found out that his wife is having an affair with his research partner! This is the guy he's been working with for fifteen years! {BR} It's a long term affair, they're {BR} they're moving in together, she's taking the kids! {BR} He's completely crushed, poor alternate Ithaca Tom. He {BR} he starts drinking {BR} he can't keep his {BR} lecture notes together, he can't keep his research together he's coming up for tenure and it's all  falling apart, {BR} and in the midst {BR} of his turmoil, he's suddenly {BR} pierced by this vision {BR} of himself, driving a Volkswagen van. {LG} He's off to camp, uh, it's a Tai Chi camp! {LG} He's {BR} he's not married, {BR}, he doesn't have kids! he doesn't even have a job! {BR} He's completely free. It looks so good this image, {BR} it pierces him to his heart {BR} . It begins to hang around him and to haunt him {BR} like a hungry ghost. {LG} {NS}\n",

      "I grew up in a really small town in Alabama. {LS} {BR} And my sister was and is to this day a remarkably beautiful woman. And I was always really good in school. {LS} {BR} {LG} So it fell into this pattern with my family where people would say things like \"she's the beauty you're the brain\" {LS} And among my almost anorexically petite friends growing up {BR} {LS} at five foot five a hundred and forty pounds it was universally acknowledged {BR} that I was the fat one. {LS} {BR} The whole thing really started in first grade I have to say. There was a weigh in in school. {BR} {LS} My best friend Nan Coley who was going to go on to become the head cheerleader of our high school hopped on the scale, {BR} and weighed forty five pounds. {BR} But when I jumped on, the needle cropped uh creeped up to fifty. {BR} {LS} And I looked over and I could see Nan looking at me in horror, not just for me but for herself. {BR} And she suggested right then and there that I go on a diet. And so I did. {LS} {BR} For the next twenty years. {BR} I would never wear a bathing suit without putting a t-shirt over it first. {BR} I would never change at a sleep over party without getting in a sleeping bag. {BR} I would never let a lover see me naked with the lights on. {LS} And not once did I ever stand in front of my closet {BR} to pick out an outfit with any other intention other than to look as thin as possible. {LS} {BR} Now along the way well meaning people tried to help but just made things worse. {BR} Such as my stepmother, the Baywatch extra, who decided when I was eleven {BR} you know, {LG} at eleven years old she decided to give me a makeover but the result was something like if you put blue ah eyeshadow and frosty pink lipstick {BR} on a cabbage patch kid. It wasn't good. {LG} But somehow I managed to get through high school and college, {LS} and at age twenty six I packed up my baggage {BR} and moved to Southern California, {LS} {BR} where {BR} surprisingly I actually got better {BR} there was something about, like all the you just extreme views that people had about their body, all the fake everything, {BR} um and the bleach blonde hair that made me kind of give up {BR} {LG} I think I kind of, I think I kind of threw in the towel, and so I joined the gym down the street because it was cheap, {BR} and I discovered that lifting weights could be actually fun because you would get strong,  {LG} and then with my newfound muscle tone I put on shorts for the first time ever and went for a hike which led to a run and then when food was no longer the enemy I started cooking {BR} healthy food {BR} and after six months I actually lost twenty pounds. {BR} And one day I was getting dressed to go out and I actually glanced in the mirror, which of course I usually avoided, {BR} and um I realize, I almost didn't recognize myself. And I I I examine myself from head to toe standing there in my bra and panties {BR} and discover that I actually couldn't lose any more weight, {BR} and I actually look pretty darn good. {BR} Now, around the same time my boyfriend was back in Boston, and he had decided to produce an independent film. {LS} And he was begging me to come back east to produce the film for him. {BR} But in order to do that, I calculated that I was going to have to raise two thousand dollars over the next four months somehow extra. {BR} Which my eleven dollar an hour temp job really wasn't going to produce. {LG} {BR} So I went out and got a copy of the L. A. Times, and as I was perusing the ads for like you know chuck-e-cheese night manager and you know {BR} evening legal secretary work, I saw an ad that said, {BR} dancers wanted. {LS} {BR} earn up to five hundred dollars a night {LG} .  Now, you know you have to understand that I cannot dance. I'm somewhat famous among among my friends for having tripped over my own feet when I was in college in Boston and actually knocked myself unconscious on the sidewalk. {LG} It's true. {BR} So I ignored it and went to the other ads but I kept coming back to it, like five hundred dollars a night! {BR} So I threw down the newspaper, {BR} and I ran to my room, and and examined my butt carefully in the mirror, like, could it be that my butt was good enough? {BR} And I picked up the phone, and made and appointment with a woman named Samantha. Now {BR} my best friend Steve was very against this. He said, Catherine, your newfound self esteem has been too long coming and too hard won {BR} for you to risk it all because some bitch down at the strip club doesn't think you're good enough! And I knew he was right, but I somehow couldn't stop. I just had to see {LG} . So {BR} the next day, I put on my sluttiest outfit, and made my hair huge, and put on like all the make up I owned and I went down and as I walked into the club, the most beautiful woman I've ever seen to this day was pulling herself upside down, naked, up a pole, with grace. {LG} And I was like, what am I doing? But just then I heard someone say, {BR} \"you must be Renee!\" Now, Renee was a totally insane alcoholic legal secretary that I worked with, {BR} and I think I was hoping to channel her so I picked that as my fake name. {BR} {LS} And I said, yes, I'm Renee, {BR} and I thought there was going to be all these questions, and I had to memorize this detailed like personal history that was all a lie {BR}, but she just took one look at me, and said, when can you start? {BR} So {BR} while I wanted to in my head I was thinking, like no way! {BR} um I was like, how about Monday? And she said ok. {BR} {LS} Over the weekend I went out and bought a brand new pair of silver panties and a silver push up bra and these really amazing silver high heels. {LS} {BR} Now my Steve was still trying to talk me out of it, he was like \"Catherine, {BR} the smarter the stripper the more they hate stripping. What are you gonna do when some asshole comes up to you and says, hey, you're pretty hot {BR} . Do you want to give me a blow job afterwards in the parking lot? {BR} You're going to want to tell him to fuck off, but what you're going to have to do is go, Well, I'll get fired if I do that but I'll be fantasizing about it the entire time you're on I mean I'm on stage\" {LG} {BR} And he said \"do you think you can do that?\" And I was thinking, you know, for five hundred dollars a night maybe I can! {BR} {LS} So {BR} um so uh so uh insanely that Monday morning I actually went to work at my temp job, and so at five o'clock I got off {BR} and showed up at the club wearing my temping outfit which was these very baggy awful black pants, and a little sailor top, my hair you know very straight {BR} and my glasses. {BR} And as I walked it I was told to go over and tell the D.J. what my song would be. {BR} {LS} And I walked over and I was like \"Hi, I'm the new girl {BR} I'll be dancing to Alanis Morisette {BR} {LG} and he was just like, alright {BR} and he says, the dressing room's over there.\" And I looked at the dressing room and suddenly I realized {BR} that behind that dressing room were probably ten drop dead gorgeous women {LS} {BR} and I was like oh my god and so I looked at the door, and I looked at the door of the club, {BR} and just then, I heard \"hi, you must be the new girl. I'm Chloe\" And I turn and to my right {BR} was this little Patricia Arquette sort of knock off girl and she was wearing {BR}  stars on one boob and spangle on the other and one of these seventies style bikinis, {BR} with a little silver skirt and she was adorable {BR} um {LS} she was like \"hi I'll show you the way\" So Chloe grabs me by the hand, drags me off and leads me into the dressing room. {BR} And I start getting dressed with the other girls, and actually the other girls were pretty nice. Um and so they explained to me the rules of the club, which I hadn't known before, {BR} um in the first place the first song, you did you know in your bra and panties, and little and whatever you wore after. But the sec And they were like the the  \"only the second song {BR} is topless\" And I was like \"the second song is topless.\" I think {BR} I think the whole time I'd been picturing that I'd just go out onstage and flit around a little and at the very end I'd drop my bra and run. {BR} {LS} But no! You had to be topless for an entire song, and I'm like \"oh no\" but I was like, ok, and they were all looking at my like you can't back out. So like I'm taking off my clothes and everybody's just naked {BR} and so just then um the D.J. who's this you know, three hundred pound man named Rudy {LS} {LG} comes into the room {BR} and he says um and he's like \"Hey girls\" and all of the girls are kind of like \"aaaah! Rudy! Get out Aaaah!\" {LG} {BR} {NS} And {BR}  like, I'm naked! And like but I didn't even care. And and I realized at the time that maybe I'd gone somewhere that I'd never been before mentally and maybe I was gonna get through this night. {BR} Um so Rudy leaves, and um I'm starting to get dressed and the girls go, no, you can't wear these silver panties, you have to wear a g-string, and I was like, oh no, I don't have a g-string, well, bye, bye bye! {BR} Um {LG} but {LG} {LS} Janee {BR} was this leggy blonde {BR} from Texas whose claim to fame was that she stripped into her sixth month of pregnancy {LS} {LG} Janee says, \"hi um I just washed mine, here  you can borrow this\" and she throws it at me and I'm like \"alright\" . So I'm putting on a strange girl's g-string {BR} {LG}  and I put it on, and the girls, um help me do my hair, and like make it huge, {BR} and they put on my make up and like fake eyelashes, and all this stuff, {BR} and up I was ready to go, and as I walked out I glanced in the mirror. And I have to say that I looked {BR} unbelievable. {BR} {LG} So {BR} {NS} Thank you {BR} {NS} So {NS} um {NS} so I go out and I go back out to Rudy, {BR} and I'm like, hi, I'm ready for my song, and he looks at me and he's like {BR} \"Holy shit box! all that was under there?\" And I was like {BR}  \"Thank you!\" {BR} {LG} um  {LG} So then um Chloe starts giving me a tour of the club, and as we she's doing this, {BR} this guy comes up to us on crutches, {BR} he'd uh he claimed he'd been shot in a gang fight {LS} and he comes up to me and he goes \"you're pretty hot, ya know I'll put you in a music video if you'll give me a blowjob after the show\" {BR} And I'm like, Steve, you know, and um Chloe says, you know, grabs you know jumps back and screams \"Fuck you! she's a stripper not a goddamn whore!\" And I was just like, nice!! {LG} Nice. So {LG} {LS} then um so then we walk back out and uh and it's horribly the beautiful woman, from like the audition day, um {BR} was out on stage again and she was an incredible dancer and she's running around and I'm just like {BR} uh oh my god and so I could tell Chloe I'm like you know I'm really a little nervous {BR} and she goes \"no no no, you'll have no problem.\" She's like \"it's not the best dancers who make all the money {BR} It's the girls who can really connect with the men, who can look from guy to guy to guy and make the guy think they're only looking at them. {BR}\" Um \"and it's really not being about a dancer, they just want to see you nude up there, um but the biggest problem you're gonna have {BR} is that you're gonna get bored. \" Now {BR} being bored {BR} was not something that occurred to me as it was going to be a problem {LG} She's like \"no, you know, I have a special trick, it's called the drop and role. {BR} So what you do, you know, is you go out there and you sort of like slowly slowly slowly slowly lower and like slowly slowly slowly roll around, she's like they'll picture you rolling around in their beds, {BR} and then slowly slowly slowly slowly stand back up, and if you do it slow enough it could take like two minutes!\" And I was like great! {LG} Um {BR} so I go out, and um so then Chloe has to do her song {BR} {LS} and I go and I sit down near the door {BR} and um I get a coke to drink because I didn't want to drink alcohol because I had to drive home, like I'm such a nerd, and so I sit there, and um all of a sudden like it was a really cold night, and um the wind blew in and I got really cold, and of course I hadn't eaten  for like three days, cause I was so nervous, you know kind of like today, and um, so I was like I started to freak out and I looked up and I was just like, \"what what am I doing?\" And so I go over to Chloe, who's come off stage now, and she's sitting {BR} next to um mister shot in the leg guy like they've made up now they're friends again {BR} {LG} and so I go over and I'm like \"hi\" {BR} \"you know, like you have been so great, and thank you so much, but I just realized, that {LS} like I can't dance, {BR} so I'm going to go home, and practice, and I'm gonna come back. {LS} And Chloe looked at me {BR} right in the eyes, and she said \"if you walk out of that door, right now, {BR} you will never come back, and you will regret it {BR} for the rest of your life.\" {BR} And I knew that she was right. {LS} {LG} And just then mister shot in the leg guy reaches out like under the little dress I'm wearing and grabs my bare ass. {BR} And you know just squeezes it and he slaps me in the ass and he says {BR} you know \"This is the worst, you feel this, this is the worst thing that's gonna happen to you all night, and he smacks me and he goes \"now get out on that stage\" and I was like \"Alright!\" {LG} {NS} {BR} {BR}  And so, so I went out onstage and you know so I went out and I walked over and there was a pole, and so I sort of swung around the pole, and like Chloe's running around getting everyone to yell and scream {LS} a very supportive friend {BR} and um so like I'm running around and um but and all of a sudden, insanely, I run out of things to do. {BR} And I'm like oh! the drop and roll! {LG} So I'm like lower lower lower lower lower, roll roll roll, and as I'm rolling around I feel something hit my cheek. {BR} And I'm like oh my god, I'm so bad, they're throwing napkins at me {LG} And but I turn my head to the right onstage and I open my eyes, and I saw that it was a dollar bill. {LG} And i was like, oh and so then, I like lean off like this, and I see standing above me is mister shot in the you know gang fight man and he's standing over me with a roll of ones pulling them off and dropping them down on top of me {LS} . And all I could think {BR} was I swear to god was what would my ophtha ophthalmologist father back in Alabama think, if he could see me right now. {BR} {LG} So um, but then like everyone was throwing money, and it was amazing and so I got up {BR} {LS} and then it came to finally be the dreaded topless song, {BR} and so I went to the special topless part of the stage, and the song started, {BR} and um I unhooked my bra, very slowly, and slowly the strap and slowly the strap {BR} and then I let the bra drop to the floor, and I stood there in front of a hundred and fifty people, {BR} wearing only a g string. {LS} {BR} The whole crowd went nuts. And I have to say, {BR} it was one of the most amazing moments {BR} of my entire life. {NS} um {BR} {NS} {BR} No one in that club gave a shit what I made on my SAT. {LG} No one cared that I was a straight A student. No one cared that I was in the gifted class when I was eight. They just wanted to see me nude. It was so cool. {LG} {LS} {BR} I never went back to the club after that night. {LS} In the first place, security was pretty lax. {BR} Um Chloe kept making like like little passing remarks {NS} Ok. Chloe {BR} Chloe kept making remarks about how \"only a few of our friends have been killed by customers\" which I found disconcerting. {BR} Um but the worst part was ah the next day at work, walking across the sony lot, I suddenly was examining every strange man that passed me I was noticing them and checking them out. {BR} And um, I've always been one of and they they seemed kind of yucky to me {BR} Um I was sort of it's like every man was suddenly a customer. {LS} I've always been one of those women that really loves men, and I thought, if this is what I'm like after three hours, what am I going to be like after three months, or three years? {BR} Um, but several good things came out of it. In the first place, one of the customers taught me this really cool trick, which is if a guy's pawing you, you hold his hand, cause he thinks you're holding his hand, {BR} but what you're doing is you're holding his hand off of you {BR} {LG} This came in super handy the next summer, in my ba uh career as a film producer. {LS} {BR} Um but the best thing of all is that {BR} to this day any time I'm having a fat day {BR} or I've just broken up with someone, or I'm just feeling a little down about myself, {LS} all I have to do is open the door and peek into the back of the closet where I still keep those silver high heels {BR} , and I know in my heart that everything {BR} is gonna be ok. Thank you {NS}\n",

      "{NS} Tom Waits loved the novel JT Leroy had written {LS} called \"Sarah\". He wanted to do an interview, with JT Leroy for Vanity Fair magazine, and he wanted JT's input, on who would photograph the spread, cause JT Leroy was notoriously shy. {BR} One of the reasons why JT was so shy was cause JT didn't have a body. JT was an avatar.{BR} So let me take you back some years. I was sixteen, seventeen years old, and I was a ward of the state, {BR} in a group home in New York city. Eight girls, one bathroom. {BR} And {BR} the girls had all had stories {BR} being, some had been raped {BR}, stabbed by a parent, sold into slavery. Everyone had secrets. At night time we would tell our secrets. {BR} And you couldn't tell. And I was the one they would come to and would tell their stories. And if you asked me why I was there. I don't know. All the intakes. Dysfunctional family. I dropped out of school. I don't know. {BR} I was always interested in \"How do you tell?\" And there was this movie, Street Wise, it was a documentary by Mary Ellen Mark {BR} about homeless kids in Seattle. And I gathered up {BR} some of my friends, my best friend Lauren, from the group home, {BR} we had been institutionalized together prior to the group home. {BR} And we went and saw this movie, {BR} and {BR} we saw ourselves on the screen. {BR} {BR} Now, the street {BR} can seduce you, {BR} and these kids were getting swallowed, {BR} and we knew we were just one step removed. {BR} And when we left {BR} the movie, {BR} I saw how people looked at us. Right before, they were kind of scared of us, and I got off on that, {BR} you know, cause we had street all over us. {BR} {BR} But after the movie they looked at us with this kind of curious compassion. {BR} {BR} And suddenly I didn't want to be the victim in the movie, I was interested in \"How do you make that bridge so people suddenly care? And you're curious enough to maybe care? How do you do that?\" And in the group home {BR} everyone's telling their stories, {BR} and I don't even know how to tell mine, I don't even have the tools to tell mine. {BR} And I would go to buy a little relief, to a street corner, there was a phone booth right on the corner, and I would {BR} remove it from me. I'd be a boy {BR} and I'd call hotlines, and I'd tell them {BR} all the stories, my stories, my pain, everyone's stories. {BR} The house parent, {BR} who survived the Biafran wars, who would say to me, {BR} \"Laura, your job is to tell our stories.\" {BR} Cause in the group home my job was, I was the translator, so {BR} some girls having some problems with the house parent, they'd come to me and I would translate between what each other was saying. {BR} Again, {BR} if you asked me, I don't know. {BR} {BR} All I knew {BR} is if you heard {BR} what my story was, {BR} my deepest belief, {LS} was that you would say, \"Well you deserve it. {BR} Wheh stih you're disgusting. You're horrible.\" {BR} My deepest hope {BR} was that you wouldn't, but I never ever gave you the chance. {BR} But I wanted to learn the tools, to tell, cause that's the bridge. And I won a scholarship to the New School for Social Research, and they let me in without the SATs. I said, \"I can't take the SATs, my last grade of completion is sixth\" {BR} And they let me in {BR} with a with an essay. {BR} And I'm taking every writing class I can get my hands on and I wrote this piece {BR} in this class about: {LS} you can tell a kid that's not gonna survive long on the street because the scars run this way, {BR} and the kids are there wrap enwrapped you know, and, and, and everyone's looking to see whose exterior matches the story. {BR} And everyone's looking at this one cool guy, he's all raggedy. {BR} And I'm in the group home {BR} and I'm just looking. I'm looking at him too and I wanted to be him {BR} cause he matches the voice. {BR} And I don't want them to know it's me cause it's going to ruin it. {BR} I wanted to be him. {BR} And then when they leave, cause they don't know, it was anonymous, reading the story, {LS} and then and then when we leave, {BR} {BR} I hear people talking about, \"Wow, I never thought of it that way. I didn't know that about {BR} this scene and that.\" {BR} And I'm like, \"That's what I want. {BR} {BR} How do you get people to see what they never what they never saw before? They, they never knew before.\" {BR}{BR} I keep writing, {BR} but never as myself. {BR} The writing gives me a little more relief. {BR} I start writing under the name Jeremy, {BR} which becomes JT. {BR} {CG} {LS} {BR} For me, {BR} I buy myself another day {BR} everytime {BR} I can find a way to tell, but as long {BR} as it's not coming from me, never as a woman. {LS} {BR} So, when I got asked by Tom Waits, {BR} when he asked JT Leroy who he wants to photograph Mary Ellen Mark. {BR} My sister in law came over one day, {BR} and she just shaved her head. {BR}{BR} And I'm looking at her and she looks like {BR} the blonde hair blue eyed little boys that I would see in the after school specials when they were just starting to talk about abuse, sexual abuse, {BR} {LS} always a blonde hair, blue eyed, cute little boy that you would forgive and love {BR} no matter what they did, no matter how transgressive {BR} and bad they were, {BR} you just loved them. {LS} I I never saw myself represented in any of that. {BR} {BR} So, she looked, {CG} she was JT. {BR} And she agreed to be my avatar. {BR} {BR} Now Mary Ellen Mark said that the person she was photographing {BR} did not feel like somebody who had suffered, liked someone, {BR} it felt like someone who maybe came from privilege. {BR} But she said the books {BR} needed to be in the world, that the books showed a world she had never seen. {BR} That she wanted the books to be out there. {BR} And she photographed the avatar. {CG}{LS} I continued to publish under the name JT Leroy. {BR} I wrote the book \"Sarah,\" which was received with great acclaim. {BR} I published it as fiction, all my work as fiction. {LS} {BR} Came to pass, {BR} that this book, that explored {BR} the wilds of West Virginia,{BR} a state I had never been in, {BR} in this kind of magic. I played with gender, and identity, and {BR} it's the spirit, everything that I had experienced. {BR} All the pain, {BR} all the suffering, the joy, the hope, {BR} the holding on to finding that a possibility of being saved no matter what. The spirit. {BR} The humor. {BR} It was all in there turned upside down, in this book \"Sarah\" {BR} came to pass {BR} that I am revealed as JT Leroy. {BR} The articulation in the New York Times is {BR} \"Hoax.{BR} Perpetrator.{BR} Culprit. {BR} The jig is up. {BR} Come clean. {BR} Liar. Fake fiction writer.\" No {NS}. New York Times. Fake fiction writer. {LG} {BR} Oscar Wilde said, \"Give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth.\" {LS} {BR} I received death threats, {LS} {BR} hate mail, was black listed, sued in federal f {NS} ing court. {BR} People didn't understand why I wouldn't apologize. \"She won't apologize.\" {BR} I wouldn't. How could you apologize for what kept, it kept me alive. I couldn't do it another way. {BR} I knew no other way. {BR} Slowly, {BR} the fan mail came back. I would get letters where people would talk about what the work meant to it, {BR} how it transformed them, how it saved their lives, how it allowed them to see a world that they had never seen before. {BR} I got invited to speak, welcome back into the community of artists, {BR} to speak all over the world. {BR} In spring, {LS} {BR} I did a sold out reading at Foyles in London, and I'm signing books, {BR} as me. {BR} And these collectors are there, {BR} and {BR} you know I'm I'm signing books, where editions in languages that I didn't even know existed. {BR} And {BR} uh uh, \"This. Sign this. Sign this. Sign this.\" And {BR} I'm leaving my body. {BR} And all of a sudden the crowds kind of part. {BR} And this girl comes walking towards me she's big, {BR} and she's got cuts all over her arms, {BR} she's carrying a bag, {BR} and I know what's coming. It's what I've been preparing for my whole life. {BR} She reaches in her bag, {BR} and I know she's gonna stab me. And she takes out a book. {BR} And she tells me {LS} {LS} that she came to my work after the reveal. {LS} {BR} She ah asks me to sign her diary. {LS} {BR} I realize that everything that had happened up to that moment, {BR} had prepared me for this. And I got up, and I held her. {BR} {LS} Thank you. {NS}\n",

      "In all honesty I'm gonna start out by admitting I sometimes lie. {BR} {LG} Occasionally I'll include a lie in the story I'm telling if I think it'll make the story better. {BR} {LS} I don't do it to protect the innocent, because I don't know any stories where the people in them are innocent. {LG} And I don't do it to be shocking either. {BR} Though I admit to {BR} to once telling a story where I exaggerated the length of my penis. {LG} In my own defense I exaggerated down and not up. {LG} And I did it for the laugh, you {BR}. {LG} The story I'm telling you tonight does not have a lie in it. {BR} Or many laughs for that matter.  When I'm done telling you this story you may think it's nothing but a lie {BR}. But I'd ask you to trust me on this. {LS} At the age of nineteen, {LS} I fell prey to a powerful and deeply corrupting influence. It dogged me for six years, {LS} costing me many a friend, and in process bringing my family to ruin. {LS} It crippled me to such an extent that I have spent the intervening fifteen years recovering from it. The influence I speak of is hope {LG}. Now you should know at the get go there's nothing in my childhood to suggest I might find myself on such a wayward path as that. My parents loved me terribly. They taught be right from wrong, {BR} they taught me to be courageous in the face of bullies, they taught me patience and forgiveness, they taught me that love would see you through any misfortune. {LS} {BR} My trouble began on independence day. Not the independence day but my independence day. {BR} My independence day occurred on memorial day, nineteen eighty two. {BR} That was the day I told my family I was gay. {LS} {BR} The act itself \"mom, dad, I'm gay\"  {LG} {BR} was relatively unexceptional. In fact it should have been more exceptional, and I've always sort of wished that it had been. {BR} {LS} However subsequent events overshadowed it and it pales by comparison. {LS} {BR} The subsequent events occurred in my absence, after the fact, as I was in my car {BR} driving back to college to take my final freshman exams. {BR} I remember being on the highway and thinking how, you know I kind of expected my parents to freak out a little {LG} and, you know  to my surprise they had not freaked out, they'd been calm and cool and collected {BR}  oddly calm and cool and collected, but still I was really happy as I drove back to school. {LS} Meanwhile subsequent events were busy unfolding back home. {BR} My mother was going through the house where I grew up and was gathering together things I'd made for her. Um a jewelry box when I was in four H, {BR}  and a painting when I was sixteen. Um a box of letters or a box containing the letters that I'd written them from school, which I used to do every week. {LS} She was removing photographs from the walls and placing them in little piles around the house {BR} and she was directing my father who never dared not follow her direction {BR} to take the bed and the desk and the chair and the lamp and the Smith Corona, {BR} my smith corona even {BR} , and to put them all in the front yard, {BR} next to the rock garden not too close to the maple tree. {BR} {LS} My clothes, my books, my bookcases, {CG} my report cards, my Farah Fawcett posters, my shoes, {BR} three years worth of interview magazines, the good ones with the Andy Warhol covers, {LG} everything. {LS} Then with my brother and my sister and my grandparents watching, {BR} my mother removed a cigarette from this tiny crocheted case she always kept them in. {BR} And she lit the cigarette, and then she took the match and put it to the pile of things there in the front yard that contained the soul and complete record of my existence in my family. {LS} It burned for seven and a half hours {BR} thanks in part to the addition of some lighter fluid to help get the larger pieces of furniture going. {LS} All of it all that was me prior to that memorable memorial day, {BR} {NS} up in flames. {LS} According to my sister who years later recounted these details to me {BR} it was a {BR} mighty impressive blaze {BR} {CG}. In their eagerness to feed it, {BR} and due to an unexpected wind off the fields around the house, {BR} the sugar maple that was older than my great grandfather caught a spark in its branches, {LS} and was sacrificed. {BR} {LS} They {BR} cut off all communication with me. {BR} They emptied and closed our joint bank account {BR} there goes college, {BR} they barred the door, they stopped talking, stopped answering my letters, stopped taking my calls. They stopped anything with me. They just stopped. {LS} I was {BR} completely disbelieving. I mean this didn't make any sense. Uh All of my friends had you know stories about telling their families they were gay, and they all ended the same way. Sooner or later everything worked out fine. So {BR} . I even had a friend named Neil whose parents had done the same thing, you know, and first they'd stopped talking to him. {BR} But one year later they were inviting his new boyfriend to come home with him for the holidays. {LS} Everyone counseled me to \"have a little patience\" and \"have a little hope.\" And this is how it starts. Slowly, just a little hope, just enough to get you through. {BR}  But hope is cumulative. {BR} A little bit here and a little bit there, it builds up in the system until it becomes something toxic. Denial. {BR} I mean, their reaction had been, yes, extreme, but not the worst that could happen. The thing to do was to be a good son, to make them proud, to earn back their love. {BR} {LS} So I got a job. And then another and then a third. Three shifts, three restaurants. {BR} Six days a week. {BR} That would show them. {LS} But they weren't watching. {BR} I wrote them letters, lots of letters. {BR} About nothing you know. It's uh  Tuesday and it's hot, {BR}  or my new roommate is named Kathy. Or my friends took me out for my birthday yesterday. They didn't write back. {BR} Living for me sort of came to a halt. {BR} Um despite the fact that my life just went on and on. {BR} I didn't think about my future, I didn't think about my needs, I didn't think about my sadness, I didn't think about any of it, I didn't have to because I had hope, everyday, whispering in my ear {BR}  \"don't give up, don't walk away. {BR}  You're almost there. Don't stop, don't grow, don't develop. Don't, don't worry. Just don't make any sudden movements or you'll blow it.\" {SL} {BR} Uh so six years went on like this without a word from them. {BR} {LS} So finally, {BR} hurt and confused beyond my ability to hold it in, and frankly finding it really difficult to maintain the illusion that this was temporary {BR}  I {LG} decided to kind of make one more attempt, to force the issue. {LS} so I I flew home and showed up unannounced at my mother's office. {LS} It was an amazing visit. Excuse me. {SL} {LS} I asked the receptionist to {LS} to page my mother and tell her she had a surprise visitor {LG} And I stood there in the lobby, and I remember seeing my mother come down this long hallway toward me. {LS} And she was walking and then she sort of looked up, and she saw me, and then she recognized who it was, {LS} and she turned and walked away again. {BR} It was a really amazing ninety second visit. {LS} {BR} Two and a half weeks later, a black {BR} funeral wreath was delivered to me at my office, with a note that said \"in memory of our son.\"  {NS} {LS} Clearly it was time to give up hope and take up therapy. {BR} {LG} So I uh {BR} I talked to a counselor who asked me why I had invited this turmoil into my life?  {BR} I uh I talked to a minister who suggested a Christian youth camp, {LS} {LG} I {LG} I talked to a lesbian who offered to slash my mother's tires if I'd pay for her flight there {LG} I signed up for scream therapy where I beat pillows with tennis rackets and screamed obscenities {BR} and you know pulled a muscle in my shoulder {BR} . Mostly I talked to friends {BR} and mostly the pain persisted. {BR} The sheer weight of it nearly crushed me, or at least that's how it felt at the time. {BR} Since it was my constant companion I spent {BR} most of my time turning it over in my mind {BR} fingering it like some sort of psychological worry stone. {LS} Over the years, it's been eroded by so much handling. All that remains now is a small, {BR} hard, {BR}  nearly weightless pebble really. Worn away is most of the anger, and much of the hurt. But one question remains: {BR} how was it possible that they taught me love and loyalty in excess of that which they themselves possessed? {LS} I have {BR} come to believe that it's not possible to understand {BR} what they did, not possible for me anyway. {LS} To understand it would seem to {BR} indicate that there was some justification for it. And I know for certain that there is not. {LS} Still {BR} there's no escaping my parents, this um this thing they did, this extreme {BR} and unfathomable and many layered thing they did tore a hole in the middle of my life. {LS} I have spent years and a lot of money {BR} darning that hole while trying to keep the rest of my world from unraveling. And yet their influence on me is enduring. {BR} {LS} My parents loved me terribly. {BR} {LS} I have been courageous in the face of bullies. {BR} There is such a thing as too much patience, but no such thing as too much forgiveness. {BR} And love has {BR} seen me through every misfortune. {NS} thank you {NS}\n",

      "So I get a phone call from my mom,  and she tells me that my father {BR} is about to get on an emergency life flight from our {BR} home in Montana, to go to Denver, {BR} to get an emergency liver transplant. {BR} My mom is kinda perennially {BR} optimistic, {BR} and she's telling me, don't worry, it's going to be OK. We're gonna pull through this, it's gonna be alright. {BR} But I know something is is really wrong. So I get the next flight I can {BR} to go from where I'm living here in New York, {BR} hoping that I get there before my father dies. {BR} And I'm really glad I I got that flight as fast as I did, because I was able to spend a couple hours with my father, before he passed away. {BR} And before I know it, I'm at this side of his hospital bed with my mom, and we're sobbing because he's passed {BR}. Um My dad was a he was a strong silent type, he was um he was a grew up on a farm, and he was the {BR} town one of one of two town eye doctors, so {BR} he could fix anything, you know, he could fix tractors or eyes, he could you know, no matter what. I mean he was always doing it, like behind the scenes, you know. He never wanted to take credit for it. {BR} Um. It was apparent that my mom and I and um my two brothers were gonna have to be fixing things ourself, this time around. {BR} And the first thing my mom did was was to call my two brothers. One's a year older, one is a year younger. {BR} And it was gonna be really comforting to see my younger brother, we were really close, um, it was gonna, he was really gonna support me {BR} Um. It was really gonna be much more complicated seeing my older brother. {BR} Um We'd always had a a really complicated relationship, {BR} and there was something really big about me that he did not know. And that's that the last time he saw me, um, years and years before, {BR} I was male. {BR} He was not aware that I had transitioned from being male to being female. {BR} And {BR} you know I always wanted to, to tell him. I was trying to find the right time, the right place, trying to {BR} you know, get up the nerve, {BR} um, LS I was worried about his reaction maybe that you know he was a bit conservative he had a temper, I didn't know how it's gonna happen, and I just kept s putting it off and, never found the right time. And here we are. at the time where I have to deal with all this stuff. {BR}Uh Marc wasn't the only one who didn't know my story, my whole hometown didn't know about me either. {BR} And you know I was trying to find a way to tell Marc, I just kind of figured with my hometown, I just I just would never go back there again. {BR} So my mom uh calls my brother, and in one phone call tells him that he lost his father, and that he now has a sister. {LG} Um. LS And I have to say I mean Marc was he was really great. Um. He he got off the place, we met him at the airport, he gave me a hug, um but it was awkward as you can imagine. {LG} And you know I think we did what a lot of families do at times like that, you just kind of fall back on tradish tradition. And we um LS wanted to uh do something that my mom and dad had always done every year, {BR} um because you see it was my father's birthday. He had passed away twenty minutes before {BR} um before his his sixty fifth birthday. So we all went to Applebee's, {LG} and we got a slice of sizzling apple pie, and {LG} put a candle in it, and my brother Marc who really worshipped my father, {BR} got the honor of of blowing out the candle. {BR} And when he was blowing out the candle, I re I still remember the expression on his face. He was {BR} you know trying to process my father's passing, {BR} he was figuring out why it had been so long, that the two of us hadn't talked. Something that really frustrated him. {BR} And um It was just all kind of coming together. I I took a business card out of my purse, uh it was for this job that  Marc didn't even know I had, it had my name on it, {BR} and I wrote my cell phone number on it, and I gave it to Marc, I said look, you know we haven't talked in so long, but here, {BR} any time, any place, no barriers, call me any, we're, you know, we can talk anytime you want. And my mom started crying because her {BR}, you know her her children were reuniting, {BR} and also because sh you know for years she had been running interference between the two of us and using every excuse in the book to explain why I wasn't getting back to him or why {BR} you know packages to me were being returned because they had the wrong name on them and {BR} it, you know, her job running interference was over. {BR} So Marc was in shock. Um we were all in shock. I was I was in shock because I was thinking about {BR} the fact that, you know nobody in my hometown knew. {BR} And I'm wondering if I can go back for the for um  the funeral. If I if I should go back. {BR} If my mom and my brothers really want me to, really deep down. {BR} Um LS and I'm thinking that, you know, I never even thought that I was going to go back to my hometown, and now I'm being pulled back right into it.  {BR} As contradictory as it may seem, {BR} as soon as there was a reason to go back, {BR} I had this really deep strong yearning to go back. {BR} I mean, I  I had gone to school in New York and San Francisco and travelled all over the world and this place that I thought of as home, {BR} uh that I think I really repressed, knowing that I couldn't go back there, right, I don't I don't need to go back there. But as soon as there was a reason, for me to go back there, very strong reason, I really really wanted to go. {BR} I wanted to see {BR} the house, the only house I had ever known growing up. {BR} I wanted to {BR} go back to my hometown and these people that, you know, comprise this community that I thought of as home, right. {BR} And my mom {BR} um reassured me that she she wanted me to be there, that  she in fact she needed me there for support. My brothers too. {BR} And my mom had a plan to get us there. {BR} You know, our our family had been separated for a long time, {BR} so she had the idea for all of us to rent a car, {BR} and drive the twenty hours from Denver back to Montana. So before you know it there we are in the car. You know, my has brother hasn't seen me for years, especially not as female, and here were are. {BR} And we we we had so much to do. We were plan, we were planning his servi my my father's funeral service. We were {BR} writing his obituary. {BR} My mom {BR} wanted to figure out and I did too wanted to figure out how we could introduce the information about me {BR} while still keeping the focus on my father. {BR} So she had me driving out in the you know, cross Wyoming, {BR} seventy miles an hour, she had me take dictation of of her friends, and she wanted to invite them over for tea. {BR} {LG} So she had this really strategic list. It's like, you invite Judy and she's gonna to tell all the people in the arts community, that my mom was involved in. And you're gonna tell June and June is gonna  tell all the people at Dad's office, and we'll find somebody else in the {BR} she's gonna tell everybody {BR} uh at the church. {BR} And the next night, there they were, eighteen of my mom's best friends, {BR} uh and the minister from the church where the service was was gonna be performed. LS They're drinking tea, {BR}, my mom says {BR} you all know very well by now that I've lost my husband. {BR} And I know a lot of you have wondered what happened to my middle son, who seemed to disappear. {BR} And um, she said, I want you to know tonight that, I I have a daughter. And her name is Kim. {BR} And this is my child. And I love my child. And I hope you do too. {BR} And we can focus on this tonight, we can talk about this tonight, {BR} um, you all are my ambassadors. {BR} If {BR}, someone has questions at the funeral and I'm caught up in things I want I'm going to point them to you and let you tell this story because you can talk about it in a sensitive way. {BR} And she um you know took a couple a couple questions from the people there. {BR} And the whole tea party, {BR}, ended {LG} slightly different than the tea party we hear about in the news, {LG} uh, the whole thing ended with everybody raising their teacups and saying, hip hip hurray for Kim, hip hip hurray for Kim. There were a couple amens and some applause and {BR} and then everybody went home and I swear there was a brownout from all the simultaneous phone calls {LG} that were being made {LG} dispensing the information, right? {LG} So then the next night there was a viewing f of of my father's body at the at the funeral home, LS and {BR} I had elected not to go because you know I didn't want the focus to be on me, I was gonna keep it on everybody, keep it on my father. {BR} Um but my best friend Tim from high school {BR} was at the viewing, {BR} and he calls me up, um {BR} he had only known the new me for a couple days, I hadn't even told him. {BR} Uh but he knew me really well. And he knew I was chickening out. {BR} And he called me from the the the funeral parlor and he said, hey gotta lot of people here {BR} that really want to see you. {BR} Um {NS} I should probably tell you that the people he's talking about are the football team. {LG} Um {LG} cause I used to be on the football team. {LG} And so. {LG} {NS} applause for that eh? {BR} Um and so Tim says, where are you, I gotta lot of people who want to see you. I'm like, yeah I don't want to go, and you know I  want to keep the focus on my dad, I don't want to be the. And he's like yeah, yeah, whatever.  {BR} Either you come down here, or we're gonna come up there, what's it gonna be? I said {NS} I come up here I guess. So before I know it the football team is at my front door. {LG} {BR} And couple of em have cases of beer under their arm {BR}. One case gets tossed in the snowbank to keep it cold, it's just like high school. {BR} And all of a sudden, they're in my living room. And it's this wake instantly. And a show of support for me and for the memory of my father. {BR} Right. {BR} and they're in my living room, {BR} this living room I never even thought I would see again. {BR}. And people were either laughing or crying, mostly laughing um {BR} and I remember looking around the room, and there there's Kevin, he was one of the co-captains {BR} of the football team with me. And {BR} I look over there and there's my brothers Marc and Todd and they were you know we were all very close in age so we sh had friends in common and they're telling stories about my dad, {BR} and {BR} there's um I look ah um I look over on the couch, {BR} and there's Frank, ah, {BR} sh probably should have ald you a also told you that, um, not only was I on the football team, but I was the quarterback {LG} um {LG} {NS} . And so I look over on the couch, and there's Frank, he's an offensive lineman. {LG} It's the job of an offensive lineman to project the quarterback. {LG} And Frank is protecting me once again, twenty years later under very different circumstances. {BR} And he's got his arm around my girlfriend, {BR} they're laughing and knocking back cans of cheap beer, and that was the moment that I knew things were gonna be OK somehow. {BR} And there was one more person there that night, and that was my mom. And she told me something {BR} that we ended up repeating quite a bit that weekend, ah through the services. {BR} Um she came up and she said, you know, Dad was always fixing things and {BR} it looks like he fixed this too. {BR} She said, you know, {BR} even though {BR} your father has died, you've been reborn. Thank you very much. {NS}\n",

      "I grew up a uh a huge fan of of the New York Yankees, which when I was very small involved going to games. maybe once a year with  my my father and my little brother watching uh Reggie Jackson and a little bit older watching uh David Winfield and I kind of came into my teens uh Don Mattingly who was you know my absolute favorite player and as I I went to high school in New York and {BR} it was kind of a turning point the first time that I went to a Yankee game by myself, and I started going to Yankee games by myself and it was at one of these games in the fall of nineteen ninety one that I went up to the stadium, bought a ticket {BR} to the bleachers and went and sat in the bleachers and I was watching {BR} um the game and noticed for the first time something that I'd I'd been to the stadium so many times before but I'd never seen uh this kind in right field wearing a Yankee uniform who was a bat boy playing catch with {BR} the right fielder and I'd never noticed the bat boy before and this kid could not play catch for his his life. He's throwing the ball over {BR} Jesse Barfield's head, the right fielder and he was one hopping him and I was like I I'm not a great athlete but I can play catch at least at least as well as this kid can {LG} and I don't understand why he has you know that job and and I couldn't. {LG} And so {LG} I went home that night and I tore a page out of the program that listed all the different you know Yankee executives and I wrote a hand written letter to everyone from Steinbrenner on down to Stump Merrill who was the manager at that point, and basically said my name is Matt and I'm {BR} sixteen years old and I'm a huge fan of the Yankees and {BR} you know I don't know if you can apply for this bat boy position but if you can I really would like an application and I'm so excited to hear from you that if I don't hear from you soon I'm gonna follow up with, with a phone call. so {LG} I sent these off and about two weeks went by and after you know two weeks I hadn't heard anything and so I picked up the phone and the s s the Yankee switchboard number was on the same list of executives and the secretary answered the phone \"hello New York Yankees\" and I said \"Hi this is Matt McGough and I {BR} sent a letter in a couple weeks ago about applying for a bat boy position and nobody got back to me\" {LG} So she's like, ok, well I'll take your name down and I'll have somebody get back to you and she took took my number down and another week goes by and I don't hear anything. So {LS} I pick up the phone again and I call and this woman answers the phone \"hello New York Yankees\" and {BR} I say \"Hi, this is Matt {LS} you know, I sent some letters in about the bat boy position and I called last week and somebody was supposed to call me back but you know I thought it was kind of rude that that {BR} that they hadn't. {LG} And so she you know she laughed and she asked me \"how old are you\" And I said sixteen, and she laughed some more and I didn't really understand what she was laughing at, but {BR} you know she took down my name again, she said you know, I'll I'll make sure that somebody gets back to you, so you know a few days later sure enough in the mail, um a letter arrived on on Yankee letterhead, official letterhead, and it invited me to come up to the stadium for an interview with Nick Priori, who's the clubhouse manager. {BR} So I put my jacket and and tie on, I don't even think I told any of my friends about this cause it was way way too weird to explain {LG} so {LG} I went and took the four train up to the stadium, and walked into the you know walked around the stadium and this is October, so they weren't playing in the World Series in October back in ninety one, so it was very, very quiet, and {BR} I walked around the Stadium and walked into the Yankee lobby and {LS} there's this security guard there and I {BR} introduce myself and I say I'm here for the bat boy interview {LG} and he picks up {LG} the telephone and he's like you know Nick some kid's here to see you and you know ok I'll and so he says have a seat, so I sit down in in the pinstripe lobby and I'm {BR} you know passing about ten minutes waiting for this guy Nick to come up for  the first job interview of my life, for the first job of my life, and I'm, you know, trying to think of the questions that he might ask me so I'm ready to uh {BR} tell him what my favorite subject is in school and {BR} tell him you know, why I think the Yankees need a big bat behind Mattingly you know, {LG} to win the pennant next year and what you know Mickey Mantle's batting average was in nineteen fifty six and like all these {BR} {LG} different questions and so you know, you know I'm kind of passing the time and these double doors burst open and this guy walks in, obviously Nick {BR} but he doesn't introduce himself he's, you know, could be anywhere from forty to eighty years of age {LG} he has this greased back hair and he's has a stogy between the two teeth left in his mouth and a chew of tobacco possibly also and this wife beater t-shirt and {BR} Yankee shorts and white athletic socks pulled up to his knees and he's shoe polish like uh black sneakers that are obviously like shoe polished and he just looks at me and says \"are your parents gonna mind you taking the train home late at night?\" {BR} {LG} So I say, you know, I take the train to school every day I think it I think it will be fine and he just kind of looks at me and finally I say, \"no, I don't think my parents will mind me taking the train home late at night\" and he says \"well, come back opening day.\" So {LG} that was October, you know I go home, I think I have the job, {LG} I'm not really sure, and you know six months later Opening day nineteen ninety three {LG} I show up at nine A.M., I put on my jacket and tie, I walk back to the stadium, I go back downstairs, you know, through these tunnels, and come to this, you know, big steel door that says Yankee clubhouse and I walk inside and it's complete {BR} pandemonium and you know there's {BR} uh these ball players that I'd only seen before on T.V. are across rows and rows of stadium seats and like they're there in the flesh in front of me and Don Mattingly is there over {BR} you know on the right, and I had a poster of Don Mattingly above my bed, you know, for my whole life, and he's standing right over there and Jimmy Key, the ace of the pitching staff is over there and {BR} and all these guys and, you know opening day Yankee stadium is not just a sports event, it's a news event, it's the beginning of Spring, and {BR} in New York. And Mayor Dinkins is there with his entourage and like \"it's Mayor Dinkins and Don Mattingly\" you know, it's {BR}. So uh I'm walking around and kind of lost and I figure, you know I better go find find Nick so I {BR} walk up to Nick, and I say, Nick what do you you know what do you, I'm Matt, we met a couple of months ago, what do {LG} you want me to do? It's my first first day of work so. He says, \"stay the F. out of my way\" so I kind of like {LG} shrink back and throw my backpack over on the side and just kind of wandering around in a daze and I feel a tap on my shoulder. {LS} I turn around and it's Don Mattingly, and he sticks his hand out and he says, \"how's it going {BR} I'm Don Mattingly {BR} . Are you going to be working with us this year?\" {LG} Which, you know, even at that moment, I'd never really thought about the experience in those terms, and he could have said so many other things that wouldn't have been as cool as that, like he could have said, you know, are you the, who are you, are you the new bat boy, are you gonna be working for us this year? But he said , you know, \"I'm Don Mattingly, are you gonna be working with us this year\" So {BR} I said, I know who you are, mister Mattingly, I'm Matt, I'm the new bat boy, and he's like \"Great to meet you, Matt\" {LS} {BR} I have a very big, very big job to ask of you. I've just unpacked all my bats fro from Spring Training and I don't know if it was the altitude of the flight up from Florida, or the humidity down there, or what, but the game starts in about two hours, and I need you to find me a bat stretcher. {BR} So I say ok, so I go {LG} I go and find Nick, {LG}, and I go you know, Nick is is busy, probably half a dozen ball players are like bothering him for double A batteries or, you know, my hat size, my hat's too small, or this or that, and I go up, and I'm like, Nick, I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly. And he lets loose with a stream of expletives that {BR} fell on I swear completely virgin ears {LG} like I never {LG} never heard that type of language in the movies before, or anywhere, let alone directed at me. So I kind of like rock back on my heels, and {BR} go and find somebody I can trust, like Nick's assistant Rob, and I ask him, you know, I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly, and {BR} Nick told me to go F. myself. And I {LG} I don't know what to do, so {LG} he was like, chill out, you know I saw Danny Tartabull using one in his locker. So Danny Tartabull's the you know, power hitting right fielder, {BR} I go to his locker, and I'm he's getting dressed in his uniform, and I stand off on the side, and he says, you know, how's it going? {BR} And I'm like fine. I'm Matt, I'm the new bat boy and I need a {LG} bat stretcher for Don Mattingly. And I heard you were just using one, so he's like, well I was using one but I left it in the manager's office you should probably go check in there. {LG} So I say, thanks, and he says see you around, and I go into the manager's office and walk in and Buck Showalter the manager is having a press conference with probably {LG} like eight or ten reporters. And I stand off on the side, and I'm kind of, you know. The conversation comes to a standstill basically because there's a sixteen year old kid there in his Easter blazer and jacket {BR} in standing in the manager's office  of the Yankee Stadium two hours before first pitch on opening day looking very lost and very anxious. And {LG} Showalter turns to me, and he's like \"can I help you\"? And I say, I I'm Matt, I'm the new bat boy. {LG} I'm really sorry to interrupt but {BR} I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly. And Danny Tartabull says that he left it in here. So {LG}. Showalter looks down, like beneath his desk, and you know, he's like, well you know, I do you need a right handed one or a left handed one? {LG} {NS} So this is the first moment all day that I actually, you know, this is the first question that I had that I could answer with complete confidence. Cause you couldn't have grown up in New York at that time you know without knowing that Mattingly was the best left-handed hitter in baseball. So I say, I need a left handed bat stretcher. {LG} So he's like, well, I think we maybe have a right handed one around here, but probably not a left handed one. {LG} And like you should try down at the Red Socks clubhouse and see if they have one {LG} . So I say OK, thanks you know, I'm sorry to interrupt. I go off, at this point I'm like sprinting down the hallways, like the tunnels beneath the stands the first base stands of the stadium and I run into the Red Sox Clubhouse and find their equipment manager and give him like the whole story I'm Matt I'm {BR} the new bat boy for the Yankees and Danny Tartabull left his right handed bat stretcher in uh in Buck Showalter's office and I need a left handed one and like the game's about to start, and {BR} he's like, calm down. Like, you know, we don't have one but we need one, like here's twenty bucks {LG} go up to the sporting good store on one sixty first street and River avenue and buy two {LG} . Like buy a left handed one for Mattingly, and a right handed one for us and then bring me back the change. {LG} So he gives me the twenty, I put it in my pocket, I run upstairs, you know, at this point it's like an hour before opening day, {BR} the fans are coming down, like fifty thousand fans are coming down from, you know, the subway in the opposite direction that I'm walking, I'm the only person in the world who knows that, you know, if I don't come through on this mission Mattingly is gonna go up there against Roger Clemens and the Red Sox on opening day Yankee Stadium with a toothpick in his hand, basically {LG}. So. I'm like fighting against the crowd, and feeling so much weight on my shoulders, and I make my way, you know, and I'm about to cross the threshold of Stan's sporting goods when it dawns on me, like I've played {BR} a lot of baseball in my life, and I've you know, {BR} been a big fan for a while and like I don't even know what a bat stretcher looks like. {LG} And and it, this moment that I'm like walking into the store, it dawns on me for the first, first time, like is uh is this a joke? Like could this possibly {LG} could this possibly be a joke? And if it, you know, but I had so much fear because like if it is a joke and I like go back and I tell Don Mattingly you know, I'm too smart to fall for your you know, your B. S. bat stretcher story, {LG} and I'm wrong, I'm gonna be back in the bleachers, like before my very first game, you know, and and lose my dream job. So {LG} . You know, I take three laps around the stadium, kind of convincing myself like it's gotta be a joke, you know, like it's gotta be a joke and I you know I walk back, back in, I go down the stairs, I walk into the clubhouse, Mattingly winks at me from across the clubhouse a couple of other ballplayers laugh. {LS} {BR} Mattingly goes three for five that day, Yankees win, it was my first day in pinstripes. {BR} And uh, you know, I didn't learn until later on that I was the first kid in anyone's memory to have gotten the job without having a connection, without you know, somebody knowing somebody or my dad knowing somebody or {NS} or whatever, which was, you know, a lesson {NS} a lesson in itself, and {BR} you know, as intensely naive my pursuit of that job was, you know, I was probably as naively intense in chasing the bat stretcher, but {BR} {LG} you know  the lesson in the story is, you know, when there is {BR} , with a great deal of persistence, and a little bit of common sense, even if the thing you're chasing may not exist, you can sometimes will it into being. Thank you. {NS}\n",

      "{NS} Where I grew up in the south, {BR} there was a right way to do things, and a wrong way to do things, {BR} and the right way was to do what your family and society thought you should do. {BR} And the wrong way was to do something different. {LG} {LS} {BR} By age thirty I had done most everything I was supposed to do. I'd overachieved in high school, {BR} I attended a prestigious college in the south, {BR} I had a good job, and I'd married well within the child bearing age. {BR} We'd married at my insistence of course, but neither one of us was fully on board. {BR} {LG} {LS} So except for moving up north to Boston, which caused my family to collectively take to their beds, {BR} I was on track with what we thought my life should look like, but I wasn't happy and I thought it was my career. {BR} In my family, I was expected to go into business. {BR} I had been in public relations for seven years, but I didn't like the work anymore. I mean I was good at it, {BR} but I was tired of working with clients and plus I was working with companies like retail banking, {BR} traffic reporting, {BR} hazardous waste recycling, {BR} nothing that really blew my skirt up {LG}. So I quit my full time job, and I started consulting, and I started taking classes to figure out what else I could do for a living. {BR} Now the only criterion for the classes was that the instructors and students {BR} could not know or care what the financial times was. {BR} I took needlepoint, directing, french. {BR} I found this brochure for the school of the museum of fine arts in boston, and I thought oh well this looks interesting. {BR} And I went to the school and I talked to the continuing education director and I asked him which class he thought I should take. {BR} And he said, you need to take art as process. {BR} We take burned out executives in that class all the time. {LG}I sign up. {BR} It's my first day of art school, {BR} I do my best to look artsy. {LG} To fit in. {BR} But even though I am not wearing pearls, they are still emblazoned on my chest. {LG} And our instructor Rhoda introduces herself {BR} and she says there is no right way to make art, {BR} and there is no wrong way to make art. {BR} Now this makes me extremely nervous {LG} because I have been raised that there is a right way and a wrong way to do most everything. {LG} {BR} And then she says the class will focus on process, {BR} the process of art making, not the end result. {BR} Now this makes me even more nervous, because I have been raised to focus on results and not just any results, but the best results. {BR} And there are no grades. {BR} Things careen out of control. {LG} If there are no grades, how will I know if I'm overachieving? {LG} I need to know that I'm overachieving. {LG} {LS} We start with the basics, {BR} and in my entire life I had never held a stick of charcoal in my hand, and it feels good. {BR} And I survived the first week of simple art exercises and I'm enjoying myself. {BR} And the next week Bob, one of the three instructors says, today we're gonna do gesture drawings. Very fast drawings, about forty five second poses. {BR} And we're going to draw the energy and the movement and the essence of the figure, {BR} and I am thinking, what the heck is essence, {BR} and how the heck do you draw it? {BR} And a man, the artists model, starts to undress. {BR} And I say, well that's okay. You've seed a naked man before. You've even had sex with a naked man before. {LG} Your problem is, you don't know how to draw this naked man's essence. {LG} And everybody else apparently does know how to draw his essence. {BR} As they're all busily getting out their easels and knowingly getting out sheets of paper and charcoal and other drawing mediums with which they excel. {BR} And I'm just standing there like the proverbial deer in headlights. {BR} And I begin to watch and imitate because I am clueless but competitive. {BR} {LG} And so I ask Judy, who is standing next to me, and also a mature student, {BR} I say Judy, what are these supposed to look like, {BR} because of course I think there's only one right way to do this, {BR} and we're all gonna draw the same image. {BR} And she looks at me bewildered and says, they're all going to look different. I'm paralyzed. {LG} What is mine supposed to look like? {BR} Can't I just do a slide presentation for your board of directors? {BR} Maybe conduct a communications audit? {BR} Assess your customer service capabilities? These are things I know how to do, {BR} things in which I excel. {BR} And I like to excel, {BR} and there is no way I'm gonna excel drawing this naked man's essence. {LG} And I'm about to cry, {BR} and then the competitive side of me kicks in and says well just snap out of it you big wimp and do something. {BR} So I start making these hopeless stick figures every forty five seconds, because that's how fast the poses are, every forty five seconds. {BR} And every forty five seconds I feel like a total failure, {BR} which is a lot of times in one hour {LG}. It's eighty. {LG} And the shame is enormous and I'm mortified at how inept I am and I'm like beating myself up for ever trying anything different, {BR} for even attempting anything new, {BR} and I'm in literal physical pain {BR} I am so far out of my comfort level, {BR} I mean I actually hurt. {BR} And I'm about to cry again, {BR} and that's when Bob comes over and shows me what amazing teachers can do, I don't even know what he says, all I know is {BR} he talks me off the ledge {BR} and breaks the vice grip that has a hold of me {BR} and I start to draw. {BR} At the end of class Bob picks one of my gesture drawings {BR} to put up on the wall with a bunch of other student drawings so we can discuss them. {BR} No one laughs at me or my drawing, {BR} it actually holds its own. {BR} I have drawn a naked man, {LG} and I feel like I can do anything. {LG} {BR} But things at home start to get a little tricky. {BR} My husband is an art director, {BR} one of the reasons why I married him, {BR} I loved being with somebody artsy, {BR} he seemed so exotic and interesting, {BR} he was the creative one {BR} and I was the business one. {BR} But when I started going to art school all the roles were off, the balance of power completely out of sync. {BR} So class continues for the next six weeks and it's an emotional roller coaster, I mean my thinking is shifting and breaking apart and I cry every day. {BR} And my final assignment is a wall installation, which is a term I didn't know existed six weeks before. {BR} And it includes these three wall sculptures, these sculptures made out of the new york times business sections and the wall street journal, {BR} all painted black. And they're bound in these really tight boxes, {BR} and each piece gets progressively more undone until the final piece explodes. {BR} And Bob the instructor that talked me off the ledge sees it, {BR} and he says, Tricia, you know, {BR} you really ought to apply to the museum school. {BR} Well, this thought had never occurred to me before, I mean in the back of my mind I'm gonna end up in business school, that {BR} this is a once in a lifetime event, I go back to my normal life, and {BR} I'm highly suspicious {BR} and then it occurs to me what's happening. {BR} He's hitting on me. {LG} I have no artistic talent at all, {BR} he's just flattering me until he can get lucky. {BR} And this theory sticks until I find out he's been in a committed relationship for the past eighteen years {BR} with his boyfriend. {LG} So then I start thinking of other reasons why they may want me to apply. {BR} Maybe they think I have a lot of money, {BR} and I'll be a big donor, cause I was working at harvard business school at the time, or {BR} maybe they think I know people who will be big donors, {BR} and so while I'm using all of my creative energy {BR} trying to imagine why I'm not creative, {BR} Charles, one of the instructors, comes up to me and says Tricia, you really ought to apply to the museum school, {BR} I mean you know you're an artist, you're one of us. Panic begins to set in. {BR} And I enroll in art school as a part time student but I'm still consulting. {BR} And I'm both excited {BR} and traumatized {BR} because for the first time in my life I am not following the rules. {BR} And I say to my dear friend Sarah, who's also a southerner. I say {BR} Sarah, {BR} I am so afraid of being different than everybody else. {BR} And she says oh Tricia, {BR} I'm so afraid of being just like everybody else. {BR} And my marriage begins to explode. {BR} And part of the reason is I'm not supposed to excel beyond men. {BR} Definitely not beyond my husband, but {BR} I have places I wanted to go, and he just wasn't moving fast enough, {BR} I kept pushing him to move faster, so I could move forward, {BR} and one day he just says to me, Tricia, you just want me to go places I don't wanna go.At art school, since we don't have grades, we have review boards. And at the end of each semester we put up all the work we've done and {BR} two instructors and several students review the work, give us feedback, and guide us on our creative path. {BR} And I'm driving to my review board in the jeep I've purchased for the yet to be conceived children I assume I'll have. {BR} But instead it's piled high with artwork. {BR} And at my review board one of the students writes this on his review board sheet: {BR} you seem to be a little frantic. {LG} {BR} Very perceptive. {BR} It has something to do with control. It's okay to let go, {BR} you're expecting this to be black or white, but the process won't allow that. You've got to let go. {BR} I'm not sure if he's talking about my artwork or my marriage. My husband and I separate, {BR} and a dear friend of mine says, you know Tricia I love my husband, {BR} and I love my children, but I never thought I had options. You have options. And she's right, because even though {BR} my life is blowing apart, or {BR} maybe because it is, I begin to really find my voice and step into my artwork, {BR} my mother sees it and says, {BR} why is it so dark? {LG} Why aren't there any heads? {LG} It's getting harder and harder to do my consulting work. {BR} And even though I'm getting paid a fire hose of cash, {BR} I know that if I do this work for much longer I'm gonna die. {BR} Slowly. But I'm gonna die. And I realize I'm not just in the wrong job, {BR} or the wrong marriage, I'm in the wrong life. I don't want to do what other people want me to do or think I should do anymore. All I want is to make art. {BR} I'm an artist. {BR}And the week we separate, they tear down my family home of twenty five years. {BR} And my jeep gets stolen. {BR} I have this keychain with three keys on it, one to the house I don't live in anymore, {BR} one to my family home that's been torn down, and one to my jeep that's been stolen. {LG} {BR} God is banging on my hood. {LG} So I toss the keys, head to art school, and join my tribe. {NS}\n",

      "So, about a month into my daughter's kindergarten career, beginning of her being in school, {BR} I was informed by her mother that her teacher was concerned {BR} about uh how she was doing and {BR} a month into kindergarten, {BR} you would think that there's not a whole lot that you need to know ha how to do, but apparently, {BR} my daughter was was giving her teacher cause for concern. {BR} And so at at the earliest opportunity, which was the parental uh observation day around halloween, {BR} I went in to observe the class, and uh it was all very familiar. {BR} And I it was clear to me what her teacher meant, {BR} even though it had been delivered to me in a really ambiguous and and hard to understand way. {BR} I I watched my daughter just be herself uh in this classroom. Kind of blissfully unaware of of what was expected of her. {BR} Um. It seems all very innocent, kindergarten and everything, but that's where they start training you how to be {BR} a part of society, which, if you're into that kind of thing, that's awesome {LG}. Um, but. {LG} You don't have much much choice though in this world, so I'm watching her and watching her like do her thing, {BR} and watching her teacher get frustrated with her to the point of like near anger just because she's not jumping to the next uh {BR} thing that's being assigned to her, because they have like little sections in the day or in the afternoon for they have to work on and uh, it was very familiar. Uh a nice thing that can happen with having children is that you can {BR} see yourself and you can be reminded of of of the progression of your own life through viewing them, {BR} and I was I was brought back to my experience beginning kindergarten and I I can see myself very clearly and my daughter we share a lot of {BR} similarities. And I remember being handed like rudimentary mathematics that you're supposed to start in kindergarten, and {BR} not being interested at all, so not even bothering uh it was it wasn't clear to me that you were that wa it was like required. Uh {LG} It was clear to me that she was kind of in the same place and uh, her teacher, besides rubbing me the wrong way, you know in a in a lot of ways, {BR} clearly didn't understand my daughter, I didn't want my daughter to stay in that school, I wanted her out. Um, {LS} and that could be just it it's hard to say when you're dealing with your children, because you know everyone thinks that their children are god's gift to the planet, you know. Or, sane people do. Sane people do. {BR} Um {BR}. So I I wanted her out I didn't think it was g it was a good place for her but I I didn't think anything was wrong with her. But of course I didn't because I'm her father and uh it's very difficult to see your children clearly because I I would I would like to say because of the uh incredible amount of love that you have for them but {BR} that's not totally honest because there's something besides the love, there's ego involved. {BR} Because there's such reflection of you, you want them to do good, you want them to be smart, you want them to be beautiful because you know you you're smart, and you're beautiful and you do good, {BR} you know, {LG} or that's how you want to perceive yourself in this world.  {BR} And you want your children, your offspring, to to to have that, that's maybe a little ugly, but it's true, and I think it's true for most parents. Um. So I do love my daughter a great deal, {LS} and I love myself. {BR} And I wanted wanted her out of that school and uh, her mother, a very fine woman, um, brilliant a and beautiful, we're partnered in raising her, we're not partnered romantically, {BR} didn't want to uh hear me that that maybe that that the teacher had the problem because she was beginning a career as a teacher and she always heard parents talk about {BR} how how it was the teacher's problem and that they wouldn't be able to actually see their children, and I had no idea how hard it was to be a teacher with all these kids and {BR} blah blah blah. {BR} Not blah blah blah, I'm sure she had points, but we really {LG} we're very very good at disagreeing. We can disagree very strongly. But I can see myself in my kid. And I I can see myself sitting at the kindergarten desk that she was sitting at, I can see the similarities and a lot of the similarities come down to {BR} an attribute that is slowness. Like it real slowness. {BR} That uh we share. That has been like uh frustrating to teachers and {BR} parents and friends and lovers and roommates and {LG} any number of people. Um. {LG} For instance, like, {LG} it it it really can and often does take me an hour to put on my shoes, {LG} and {LS} I I can't tell you where the time goes, it's not like I got distracted and started playing records or something, like I can sit in the same place, {LS} putting on my socks and shoes for an hour, so can my daughter. We can lose weekends just sitting on the toilet, {LG} and uh if this apartment where I where I spent time with my daughter, there's only one toilet, so that, {NS} that's easy for me to see the similarities you know, um. Uh thinking about how we see our children, and how we see ourselves and our children, and how we want to see ourselves in a in a positive light. {BR} We don't want something to be wrong with our children. Um. It makes me think about a moment in time {LS} when I was seventeen years old and I was watching television with my father, {BR} uh a an episode of NOVA, it's like a science program that was on, I think it was on PBS, I don't know if it still exists. {BR} Um. This one was on neuroscience and neuro neuroscience technology and uh. {BR} They're had a guy getting prepared for a CAT scan, and {BR} being receiving a cat scan and it filled me with this crazy wave of uh of like deja vu, but not just regular deja vu, like deja vu mixed with dread and like sickness to my stomach. {BR} And I it was overwhelming, {LS} and I couldn't stop thinking about it. And wondering if like, did I have a CAT scan? So I turned to my father and asked him if I had a CAT scan. {BR} He said no and fell back asleep. {LG} And then uh, I couldn't get out of my head, and I started remembering more and more this experience of being a little kid and getting a CAT scan, and uh. {BR} um. I finally went to my mother, asked her, and she didn't want to talk about it, and I persisted, {BR} and she uh, she admitted that I had had a cat scan, when I was six years old, something like that. {BR} And I asked her why I'd had a cat scan, and she didn't want to talk about it, but she started laughing a little bit, and uh, which is weird {LG}. From where I was standing, you know, {LG} kind of filled with dread and having like this like repressed memory come up {BR} uh and uh. Finally she admitted I had had a cat scan, and she told me why, she said I was um, {LS} so slow {LG} that they thought that I was retarded. {LG} And I had been given a battery of tests to test my cognitive ability, and the tests were inconclusive, {LG} and they couldn't figure out, {LS} the jury's still out, trust me {LG} Um. But uh, the tests were inconclusive so they thought that maybe I just had a brain tumor {LG}, and uh so they were gon they that's why I got the cat scan. I don't know if you're ever had one but uh. I don't even like giving blood for a for a blood test. I don't, I, this is actually, thinking about it right now, probably {BR} exactly why I hate western medicine entirely, {BR} and will do anything to stay away from a doctor. Um. Well a CAT scan, they have to like, take your clothes, off, if and uh if you're little and you don't want to take your clothes off in a room full of strangers, {BR} and then they, this my memory is so, I don't know. I guess they inject something into your ankle, like an iodine solution, and then you they lay you on a table, {BR} and you get slid into a tube {BR} that sends whatever rays through your body to {BR} look into your brain to see what's going on, {BR} um, totally fucking terrifying. Like uh, I remembered trying to escape, I remembered screaming until I was hoarse, {BR} I remembered uh, my father coming into the room and talking me down, I remember having my clothes put back on and taken to the gift shop and my father bought me a book of {BR} animal limericks and and rhymes and photographs of the animals, all these animals from north america, black hard covered book, {BR} I remembered that book, and I had it through childhood, but I didn't remember anything about the CAT scan, after I left the hospital cause that it sucked that bad. Um my parents loved love love me love their children {LG} uh and uh, that couldn't have been anything but painful and frightening for my father too, you know, the whole situation. {BR} Um, and I I so I'm just thinking about what motivated them to go to that extreme {BR} to see what was wrong with me. Okay so it turns out that {BR} no brain tumor as a child, just slow. {LS} I'm just slow. {BR} I have figured out ways to live my life that it doesn't really matter. As far as survival is concerned, and actually, {BR} I've been able to thrive, you know, by degrees, {BR} and and uh. I I had to think about that so tempted to sing, so tempted to push it {BR} so past the time that she starts playing and I have to improvise a song on top of it to finish the story. {BR} I won't do that {BR} um. Just thinking about um, not doing that to my child, you know, having the f having the good fortune to have a child that's so much like me that I can take my experiences and and help her, at least in this moment, I don't know what the future holds, and I don't know who she's going to become, you know, but uh, {BR} I can use my experience in a way to to lessen her her {BR} potential problems in this world. Which is what you ultimately ultimately ultimately wish for as a parent. {BR} Um her mother went to talk to the teacher a couple weeks later, and came back horrified, and wanted to but she's not a violent person but she {BR} she wanted she wanted our daughter out too. So we took our daughter out of that school. She's now at a Steiner school, which really suits her much better, {BR} and uh we're both slow. \n"
